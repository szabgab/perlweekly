   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/buddy_burden/2012/01/a-tale-of-cpan-testers.html">A Tale of CPAN Testers</a><br>
   Buddy Burden describes - in a very colorful way - the process of releasing a module to CPAN and how the CPAN tester results helped him save 3 cents.
</li>

   2012.04.30 in <a href="/archive/41.html">#41</a>
   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/buddy_burden/2012/04/lazy-cache.html">Lazy == Cache ?</a><br>
   Buddy Burden is using the lazy option of the Moose attributes as a cache.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/buddy_burden/2012/05/a-porters-tale.html">A Porter's Tale</a><br>
   Buddy Burden describes how he ported old Perl code, running on 5.8.9, to use 5.14.2. The easy parts and the pitfalls.
</li>

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/buddy_burden/2012/07/the-mind-killer.html">The Mind-killer</a><br>
   I think the story Buddy Burden shares with us is one of the best ways to explain how testing in general and TDD in particular can improve your health. I really mean it. Even if you take only part of it.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/buddy_burden/2012/12/methodsignatures-where-and-when.html">Method::Signatures: where and when</a><br>
   Last week I mentioned that I looked at a couple of modules that would allow me to use real function signatures, but I have not actually looked deep into Method::Signatures. Now Buddy Burden reports about the new release of this module with some beautiful new features. I also love the examples in the article. Especially I was wondering if there is a way to pass several arrays to a function like this f(@x, @y) and handle them correctly, or at least as array references inside the function.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/buddy_burden/2013/06/slideshows-in-vroom-so-noted.html">Slideshows in Vroom: So Noted</a><br>
   When writing slidedecks, you want the presentation software to be as inobstrusive as possible. In fact, you probably want writing slides to be as easy as jolting notes on your favorite editor. That's pretty much what Buddy Burden thought, too. Hence, meet Vroom, a vi-based slideshow.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/buddy_burden/2013/06/pre-modern-perl-vs-post-modern-perl-fight.html">Pre-Modern Perl VS Post-Modern Perl: FIGHT!</a><br>
   Last week, we saw two people complaining in blog posts about the 'modern Perl' movement. This time you can see how Buddy Burden takes on the nay-sayers barefoot! Is this a real fight? I don't think so. It is 'just' the simple tension between people who accept, and people who dislike changes.
</li>

   2013.07 in <a href="/archive/106.html">#106</a>
   <a href="http://barefootcoder.blogspot.com/2013/07/technical-debt-strategies.html">Technical Debt Strategies</a><br>
   I found this article of Buddy Burden to be very good. It describes what is technical debt, why is it called that way, and how to handle it. He shows 4 methods for you to implement.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/buddy_burden/2013/08/when-unsafety-is-a-good-thing.html">When "unsafety" is a Good Thing</a><br>
   Quite often when I teach Perl to people coming from Java or C I encounter this problem. Some people love the freedom that comes with the lack of type system in Perl, some people get nervous. I think this bare feet article by Buddy Burden is an excellent way to explain the differences and the advantages of each system.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/buddy_burden/2013/09/is-this-a-hashref-which-i-see-before-me.html">Is This a Hashref Which I See Before Me? (no, wait, it's an arrayref ...)</a><br>
   I seem to always like the articles of Buddy Burden, even when he writes about a questionable feature of Perl. In recent versions of perl you don't always need to manually de-reference references to hashes and arrays that can either make your code cleaner (no @{ } or %{ } around some snippets) but it might be ambiguous. It is certainly good to be aware of these features and decide if you will accept, encourage or ban their use in your code-base.

   As you could guess from the title, this is already the 2nd part of the series Buddy Burden writes bare feet on his road in the programming world. A very interesting conversation with ones own self.

   Bare feet Buddy Burden continues to explore his relationship to Perl.

   Buddy Burden continues telling his story. This time he explains why code readability is so important, and how that does not mean using a limited subset of the language.

   Just like English, Perl borrows liberally from other languages, is full of what seems to be redundancy, and have quite its fair share of quirks.  Coincidence? No, not really. Buddy Burden dives deep into Perl's linguistic heritage.
</li>

<li>
   2014.01.12 in <a href="/archive/130.html">#130</a>
   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/buddy_burden/2014/01/perl-and-me-part-6-perl-is-engineering-and-art.html">Perl and Me, Part 6: Perl Is Engineering and Art</a><br>
   Recently I was reading the Learning Python book and found a page titled 'Python Is Engineering, Not Art'. In the disguise of trying to explain the difference between Perl and Python it just bashes Perl. I sent it to bare-feet Buddy Burden, and he included an extensive post about this in his series about his journey in the world of Perl.
</li>

<li>
   2014.01.19 in <a href="/archive/131.html">#131</a>

   Buddy Burden continuous exploring his relationship to Perl. This time he discusses the need for the language to change and evolve.
</li>

<li>
   2014.02.03 in <a href="/archive/133.html">#133</a>

   It is Buddy Burden again, explaining how <b>Perl is the language that Gets Shit Done</b>, but probably a lot more importantly, he explained his process of finding candidates for employment. I know not many companies work that way, but I think it is great. I love it!

   You've no doubt all seen that quotation, about the three hard things in computer science: naming, cache invalidation, and date/time processing? Buddy lists everything he wants from a module for processing dates, and then rates the leading CPAN modules against his requirements. He finds them all lacking in one way another, and tells us that his next blog post will be his thoughts on how we can improve things. This feels like the start of a horror movie: "don't open that door Buddy!"

If you've a class with two attributes that get their values from different parts of the same config file, you only want to read the file if one of the attributes is used, but more than that, you only want to read it once if <em>both</em> attributes are used. Buddy shows you how.
