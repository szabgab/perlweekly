   How easy is it to install psgi-based applications using Chef? Pretty darn easy, according to melezhik's examples.

   I am not entirely sure I like that instead of adding a feature to an existing project, people create a new tool because one feature was missing. OTOH, I love the fact that people are creating solutions to problems, so let's see what Alexey Melezhik builds.

   This looks like some strange animal. A build-server for Perl applications, but running on Ruby on Rails? You might want to check it out and let everyone know what's it about?

   SWAT is simple DSL to create a smoke tests for any web application in easy and fast way. Dancer is a modern light-weight web framework for Perl

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/melezhik/2015/07/-as-devops-i-update.html">swat - Simple Web Application Test ( Tool )</a><br>
   Alexey has written a tool called swat, which is used to run smoke tests against web applications. It's <a href="https://github.com/melezhik/swat">on github</a>.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/melezhik/2015/10/swatpmorg-updated.html">swatpm.org updated</a><br>
   SWAT is a Web Test Automation Framework. It seems you need to create the routes of the server as directories and files on your local system, and put in the files the expected response and then just run swat. Interesting concept.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/melezhik/2015/10/outthentic---initial-release-to-cpan.html">Outthentic - yet another test framework </a><br>
   A new high-level black box testing framework is introduced here. The idea seems to compare the output of a given "story" against what is expected, and report if there's any discrepency between the two.

   Outthentic is a language to validate arbitrary plain text. Very often a short form 'DSL' is used for this term.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/melezhik/2015/11/sparrow---tiny-web-monitoring-tool.html">Sparrow - tiny web monitoring tool</a><br>
   The first alpha version of this web monitoring tool is now on CPAN as <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Sparrow">Sparrow</a>, and also <a href="https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow">on github</a>. Alexey is hoping that other people will join him in developing Sparrow and the <a href="https://github.com/melezhik/swat">SWAT</a> web testing framework that it's built on.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/melezhik/2015/12/sparrowhub---swat-plugins-repository.html">SparrowHub - swat plugins repository</a><br>
   swat and sparrow are two parts of a tool-chain for rapid web test automation development. SparrowHub is their 'CPAN'. And apparently Alexey is on a quest to anger some spelling enthusiasts.

   At first I thought that Alexey is a pirate who keeps talking about sparrow, but apparently that's a bird. So what is the connection between a bird and web site monitoring? Is that the good sight? Being light-weight? Or that it never seem to rest?

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/melezhik/2016/01/swat-tests-for-blogsperlorg.html">Swat tests for blogs.perl.org</a><br>
   A blog entry on blogs.perl.org about how to use 'swat' to monitor the health status of blogs.perl.org. A blogception of some sort, if you will.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/melezhik/2016/01/curl-swat-vs-selenuim.html">curl + swat VS selenium </a><br>
   You'd be hard-pressed to find such two wildly different test automation tools.  But how do they compare for the same task? Melezhik finds out.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/melezhik/2016/02/am-i-reinventing-a-wheel.html">Am I reinventing a wheel? </a><br>
   melezhik has written a plugin for his outthentic tool that reports and monitors disk usage. He is, however, wondering if he might not be reinventing the wheel. If so, he's also wondering if somebody could point him to any perl-based radial prior art.

   melezhik is musing aloud about a potential new service that would provide black box-type integration testing for modules (as opposed to the unit testing that CPANtesters provides). Interested? Let him know!

   Not getting a lot of (or any?) feedback won't stop a true believer in the cause. Alexey throws a party. You are all invited.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/melezhik/2016/03/cpanparty-is-over.html">cpanparty is over</a><br>
   It is really hard to shut down a service you built and invested in, but if the expected users don't come to the party... then it is probably better to step back, regroup and do something else.

   I like that Alex has so many ideas and so much energy. Minion is a job queue for the Mojolicious real-time web framework. Sparrow is the testing/monitoring framework written by Alexey.

   You might recall Sparrow provides automation and SparrowhHub is a list of plugins for it. In other words it is a repository of reusable automation scripts.
