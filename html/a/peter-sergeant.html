   This is the 2nd part of Peter Sergeant's article on trying to handle the developer-product manager relationship through better time estimates. He argues for using Story Points instead of time units and Velocity to balance the difference between developers. I personally don't have much use for this as I mostly write for myself but I think others could benefit from this approach. I certainly would like to read abut the experience of others.

   Peter has at one time occupied each one of the 4 roles that are dealing with the requirement of an employee so he probably knows what each one of those, including the employee, want to see in the CV. But remember, he is from the UK. In other countries his advice might be counterproductive. Or maybe they are even better than in the UK.
