   <a href="http://6guts.wordpress.com/2011/09/17/this-is-not-enough/">This is not enough!</a><br>
   One of the biggest issues I had with Rakudo Perl 6 was its speed. I can program around some bugs. I can implement some missing CPAN modules but if it takes minutes to run my code instead of seconds I'll easily lose my patience. Jonathan Worthington describes how, getting a new and faster machine got him to improve the speed of Rakudo even further. - I think it is time for me to take another look at Rakudo.

   Jonathan Worthington describes his work that will be included in the October release of Rakudo. This brings the performance of Rakudo, in some very specific cases, to be - let me be careful here - not too far from that of Perl 5.

   If you want your head to spin, read the about the dessign work of Jonathan Worthington. In a related note and much more down to earth, Nicholas Clark reported that 'NQP JVM prototype faster than Perl 5'. (Search for his e-mail, if interested.)

   Another huge step with Jonathan Worthington. NQP (Not Quite Perl) is basically the core that Rakudo, the Perl 6 compiler is built on. (Minus a few areas where I think it still depends directly on Parrot.) Having NQP on the JVM means a large part of Rakudo can already work on the JVM.

   Promises are good when they are kept. And here we go, Jonathan Worthington has already added Promises to the JVM back-end of Rakudo Perl 6. It seems he is already working in parallel, or I don't know how he manages to get so much done so quickly.

   In this part Jonathan talks about the considerations in implementing Perl on top of a stack based machine like the JVM and on a register based virtual machine like Parrot or the MoarVM. He also discussed the possibility of a virus eating all the C-programmers, hiking in the Swiss Alps, and the proliferation of Perl forks.

   Jonathan had a productive week: getting multi-dimensional arrays working in the JVM (following MoarVM, which was done previously); thinking through the design for <code>await</code> to not take up a thread when waiting for the promise to complete; thinking about a friendly <a href="https://gist.github.com/jnthn/a56fd4a22e7c43080078">syntax for supplies</a>; some useful MoarVM bytecode instrumentation; fixed some regexp issues; and improved some error messages.
