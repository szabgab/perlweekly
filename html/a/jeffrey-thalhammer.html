   <a href="http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/189">FLOSS Weekly: Episode 189 - Perl Critic</a><br>
   In this weeks episode of the FLOSS Weekly Randal Schwartz and Aaron Newcomb interview Jeffrey Thalhammer, the developer of Perl::Critic. It's an hour long video (though you can also download the audio alone) in which you can learn about the history and the future of Perl Critic. You can hear about the problems the developers encountered but maybe most importantly you can get some ideas how to get started with it and how to convince your manager and your co-workers to use it.

   At YAPC::NA I saw the presentation of Jeffrey Thalhammer (the same guy who brought Perl::Critic to us), and was quite impressed. Since then Pinto was further improved including its own version control mechanism.

   Jeff Thalhammer whets our appetite on an upcoming feature of Stratopan: a dependency-visualizing graph that is quite snazzy-looking.

   Sometimes, you'd like to use the tools, but you don't have time to learn their intricacies. In those times, who better to call than the toolmasters themselves? Jeffrey Thalhammer announces the creation of Stratopan's consulting services.

   <a href="http://blog.stratopan.com/2013/06/pinto-stratopan-in-academia">Pinto & Stratopan In Academia</a><br>
   One typical tenet of academic projects is that they must be  easy to reproduce. And managing and recreating specific environments is the thing Pinto and Stratopan do very well.  Jeffrey Thalhammer walks us through this perhaps non-obvious use-case of his tools.

   Jeffrey Ryan Thalhammer describes a very interesting code analyzis service for Ruby, that could be implemented for Perl using Perl::Critic and probably some other tools. If you are intersed in starting something that is both valuable and can make you independent, this can be an interesting opportunity.

   If there's a thing the Perl ecosystem is good for, it's to reroute around the damage. Here, Jeffrey Thalhammer shows us how to tweak Pinto to use cpan.stratopan.com instead of cpan.perl.org if the latter ever goes down again.
