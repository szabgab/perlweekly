   Olaf Alders provided his weekly report that was full of new items. You can now +1 Perl modules, use the public API of MetaCPAN and compete with other CPAN authors for fame.

   Olaf Alders tells us what happened to and around MetaCPAN in the last month. They the data collected earlier but have learned from this. Despite of this several sites started to use MetaCPAN as the default place to link. BTW this is a recursive link as Olaf started his report by mentioning the Perl Weekly. Thank you!

   Olaf Alders celebrates the first anniversary of MetaCPAN and uses the opportunity to mention the recent changes. If you still have not switched to MetaCPAN, this might be a good opportunity to give it a try.

   I never had to deal deeply with cookies, at least not with Perl, so I am not sure how painful that was earlier, but I love this. If nothing else, the name is great. Way better than some of the boring, engineer-like anti-inspiration module names.

   Olaf Alders explains the plans he had with MetaCPAN to solve at least some of the issues. I agree with him that this could be done by someone as a TPF grant. So if you need some money and would like to work on some really interesting thing with a large impact, talk to Olaf.

   Olaf Alders, the leader of the Meta::CPAN projects asks your input on how the URLs on MetaCPAN.org should look like. As this is one of the most important web sites for any Perl user, you should probably take a look at the issue. In a nutshell, what should be the fixed URL of a script supplied in a CPAN package?

   Don't get overly excited: Olaf Alders is... fluffing up the truth. What he means to say is that the Outreach Program for Women and the Goggle Summer of Code are both taking applicants, and they are both excellent vectors for students who would like to work on MetaCPAN during the summer.

   In general MetaCPAN does not accept monetary contributions, but being able to participate at the annual QA Hackathon helps Olaf Alders to allocate time to work on MetaCPAN and get others to be involved. So if you'd like to help MetaCPAN with money, the best way is to donate to the QA Hackathon. (See reports about this years QA Hackathon in the Testing section above.)

   So you are using Dist::Zilla to manage your module and you want to run a single test out of its test suite? No problem at all, you can just run it directly. But if the module also has XS components, it's a little trickier. Fortunately,  Olaf Alders found how to do it in a fairly simple way.

   The CPAN web portals, search.cpan.org and metacpan, are incredibly important for our day-to-day work, and it's easy to forget that their continued existence is usually fueled by the unrelentless dedication of a few  volunteers and a budget that would make shoe strings seem opulent. In that optic, a new sponsor is always reason to celebrate. Huzzah for Panopta!

   The QA Hackathon is an excellent event and dispite its name it is not only about Quality Assurnce. It became a more generice event when some of the people maintaining the core infrastructure needed for the Perl world get together for some much needed face-to-face conversation. I had the luck participating in two of such events, and now I  had the privilage to even provide some funds to run the event. If you, or your company relies on Perl, this is a very good place to ensure the continous improvement of the whole ecosystem around Perl.
