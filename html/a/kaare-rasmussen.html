   After a long long waiting period, finally Kaare Rasmussen stepped up and JFDI-ed. Using some earlier preparations by Kevin Dawson he converted the Padre repository that had about 100 separate projects in it, into 100 GitHub repositories. There is still a lot to do around the move, but we have already seen some activities around the repositories. It is a great opportunity to revive this project that has been almost dormant for 2 years.

   Djet is a Node Based Content Management System written in Perl. If you are confused like I was, don't worry. The 'node' in the name does not refer to Node.js, but more like the vertex in graph theory. I am not sure, but I think the code behind PerlMonks is also based on the same idea, of everything is a node.

   Kaare is concerned by the lack of modules for Perl 6 and the lack of toolchain. Should he be? Or is the green field actually an opportunity for many people to show what new ideas they have and how well they can craft nice things?

   Kaare's reflections on Perl 6, where he wonders who's going to use it, and what niche is it going to make its own?
