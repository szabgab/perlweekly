   Google is trying to get students between the age 13-17 involved in Open Source. The Perl Foundation wants to take part in it and Paul Johnson has extensively written about it. You have less than 24 hour before the deadline.

   The Perl Foundation was accepted to participate in the Google Code-in. Now it is time to find students between the ages 13-17 years who are interested to participate. That's where The Perl Foundation needs your help. See the post of  Paul Johnson (pjcj) with details.

   Paul Johnson stole some ideas from Ruby so now you can see (part of the) report from vim. Cute green >> marks and red :( marks appropriately on lines without a coverage. I tried it and for me it was only working on the files in blib/lib but maybe I need to fix something in my setup.

   <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2012/04/grant-application-improving-de.html">Grant Application: Improving Devel::Cover</a><br>
   Paul Johnson has submitted a large grant request to improve Devel::Cover. I think this is the first large grant requests - outside of core perl - and I think this is a very important one. Both, because Devel::Cover is a very important tool and because I think giving out grants of this size will enable some serious work. I think this can be a much better use of the money TPF got than trying to have many small grants. I also think that Paul is a person who will be able to execute what he planned. Please, comment on that post and if you work for a company that is serious about Perl and Quality, then let them know they could give money to TPF to run more such projects.

   One question stands out: Are you using Devel::Cover on anything else than *nix or Windows? If yes, please contact Paul Johnson ASAP! He needs your input. - Actually even if you are using it on Windows or *nix you can contact him and thank him for his work!

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/paul_johnson/2016/03/upping-minimum-version-for-develcover.html">Upping minimum version for Devel::Cover</a><br>
   Paul has difficulty testing Devel::Cover on older versions of Perl and thus he is raising the minimum required version of his module. He just wonders if anyone finds that problematic. I think there is a general issue of how much open source developers want to spend their time supporting code free of charge. What do you think?

   Paul first released <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Cover">Devel::Cover</a> on 9th April 2001, the day after Perl 5.6.1 was released. Paul has been chief maintainer from then 'til now, but he also points out that 86 other people have contributed to it over the last 15 years.

   As Paul puts it: 'A large part of the value of the QA hackathon is in the discussions that take place when people can sit together and thrash something out, or bounce ideas off each other.'
