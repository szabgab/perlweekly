   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mauke/2011/09/exit-statuses-and-how-works.html">Exit statuses and how $? works</a><br>
   Killing zombies and signaling orphans to exit the system? It is quite confusing for most of us who are not Unix system administrators by birth. Mauke helps clearing the confusion explaining how processes in Linux terminate and how, you as a Perl programmer can deal with that.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mauke/2012/11/cool-things-you-can-do-with-perl-514.html">Cool things you can do with Perl 5.14</a><br>
   Mauke introduces 3 modules using pluggable keywords that are available from version 5.14 of Perl: Quote::Code - quoted strings with arbitrary code interpolation;  Switch::Plain - a simple switch statement for Perl; Function::Parameters - subroutine definitions with parameter lists. This is nice. Just a few days ago I was searching CPAN for solutions to declare parameters for a subroutine in Perl. I have not seen this one.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mauke/2015/08/converting-glob-patterns-to-regular-expressions.html">Converting glob patterns to regular expressions</a><br>
   If programming constructs were Pokemons, glob patterns would be the first form of regular expressions. mauke shows us here how to manualy make them evolve to their final form.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mauke/2016/03/perl-curio-dereferencing-blocks.html">Perl curio: Dereferencing blocks</a><br>
   Lukas points that that the dereferencing curlies in <code>@{$foo}</code> are introducing a code block, so you can do whatever you like in there, as long as it results in an appropriate reference.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mauke/2016/06/cool-perl-6-features-available-in-perl-5.html">Cool Perl 6 features available in Perl 5</a><br>
   Cross-pollinisation is a wonderful thing. Like some of them cool features in Perl6, but not ready to take the leap into a whole new language? No worry: some of them trinkled back down into Perl5-land.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mauke/2017/05/converting-glob-patterns-to-efficient-regexes-in-perl-and-javascript.html">Converting glob patterns to efficient regexes in Perl and JavaScript</a><br>
   Recently there was a big and enthusiastic discussion when Russ Cox benchmarked several glob implementations and now Lukas shows us the fast version using regexes. It's a nice article and one can learn some regex power tools, but I still don't understand when does this have any practical impact? Have you ever used glob with more than 2 stars (*) in it?

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mauke/2017/08/fizzbuzz.html">/Fizz|Buzz/</a><br>
   The <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest">FizzBuzz Test</a> is a programming interview question designed to help  filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. I am not sure the original authors had this in their mind.... and the Aristotle golfed it. Creepy.
