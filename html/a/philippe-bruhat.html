   After a hiatus of five and a half years, Philippe Bruhat (BooK) has finally put together a new version of his module. Not only that, he also pays tribute to the political events in his country. Having this module, no one should have any excuse of giving bad names to their modules or classes or methods. See the other links about naming.

   Are you fed up using the same names in every example script? Philippe Bruhat (BooK) came to your rescue 8 years ago. Now his module is also available as a web service.

   Philippe Bruhat (BooK) explains his participation in the <a href="http://onceaweek.cjmweb.net/">CPAN Once a Week contest</a>, which in itself would need more attention, and calls upon you to send him personal e-mails indicating that you are indeed using his module.

   Git::Repository is one of the many Perl interfaces to Git. At the core, it is meant to be simple and minimalist. Recently, it began to offer additional features via the use of plugins. This latest addition to the herd  should be most pleasing to any DWIM partisan.

   The Perl QA Hackathon is a wonderful annual event for improving Perl, the CPAN ecosystem and the whole community. (I attended two of them.) Participants and organizers invest a lot of time and energy in it, but there are also expenses. The organizers are looking for sponsors to cover these expenses.

   It is a really great description of how BooK found an unmaintained module, got ownership in a nice way and released a new version of the module.

   This is the summary of the summaries with quotes from all the other posts and links to them. I am impressed both by what they accomplished at the QA Hackathon and maybe even more, by the amount of reporting they provided.

   More than 10 years after Iain Truskett, the original author of this module has passed away, and after it changed hands several time, BooK (aka. Philippe Bruhat) adopts the module. The little we can do to preserve the memory of the people who have contributed to the Perl world.

   A short explanation by Philippe Bruhat abut how he adopted this module. It is quite simple. You can do it too.

   Philippe Bruhat (BooK) shows 3 cases when he decide a module should be totally removed from CPAN and uses his examples to encourage others too to remove obsolete modules.

   <a href="http://cpan.io/pulse/2014/08/yearly-boards.html">Yearly boards and fallen authors</a><br>
   Philippe Bruhat (BooK) likes games and now with his new site, cpan.io, he has a lot of new ground to create competitions. This one is showing how long each person will release a CPAN module every week within a year. A major limitation that I can see is that this board only handles years according to the Gregorian calendar. In any case this is for the CPAN heavy-weights. If you have ideas for other competitions to encourage more ad-hoc contributions, or if you have any other idea, please <a href="https://github.com/book/CPANio/issues">open a ticket</a>!

   Philippe Bruhat might count as a professional workshop organiser. He reports on a recent hackathon held in Lyon, without actually mentioning what they were hacking on.

   You may think of him as "BooK", or "the guy in the pink shirt". Philippe has added some new pages onto <a href="http://cpan.io">cpan.io</a> which show leaderboards for all years, such as <a href="http://cpan.io/board/once-a/week/releases/years.html">this one</a>.

   Some bugs are easy to spot. Others can be sneaky. Blending with their surrounding, waiting patiently for years before the right circumstances present themselves. The present tale is about a bug of the latter category, which stayed dormant for over five years before resurfacing...

   An update from BooK about about his <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Requires::Git">Test::Requires::Git</a> module, which he started hacking on after attending <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/book/2015/04/my-perl-qa-hackathon-2015-report.html">last year's QA Hackathon</a>.

   He didn't wear the expected number of pink shirts at the QA Hackathon, but I did see at least one. He's a friend, which is why I'm allowed to mock him rather than talk about the useful things he did.
