   If you happen to be in or near Lisbon, Oslo, Lausanne, Zurich or Riga in the next few weeks you are lucky as Damian Conway comes to your city. In some places he gives free talks while in others he provides public training classes. I am going to attend one of his classes in Riga.

   Damian Conway is going to give 4 public training classes in Melbourne and Brisbane. I guess I don't need to explain why is it great to hear the Perl Best Practices from its author but maybe the Presentation Aikido needs a bit more push. I was lucky to see part of this presentation at YAPC::EU in Riga. It is great. If you give talks (e.g. at conferences or in your company) it is worth attending.

   Tom Christiansen started discussing the idea to create a set of Perl::Critic rules that will cover the recommendations of the Camel book (aka. Programming Perl). In case you don't know, Perl::Critic is the implementation of the recommendation from the book 'Perl Best Practices' written by Damian Conway. It is extendable and can server as a great tool to make sure your code follows recommended practices.
