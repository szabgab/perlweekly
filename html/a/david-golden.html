   Apparently David Golden has a similar setup to mine for IRC. Using an ssh connection to a remote server, where he runs irssi. The problem that we don't get pop-up notification when someone is talking to us. Or I'd say we did not get. Following the instructions of @dagolden one can set up a pop-up alert... Actually, in one of the comments he pointed to another solution by RGS that was even simpler to setup. So now I have notifications! Shall I be happy not? Shall I say goodbye to the little productivity I had earlier?

   A very interesting discussion on the future of Perl. I think, in his earlier post (linked from this one) David Golden covered the major ways people in the Perl community related to Perl 6 which reflects on how they thing the possible(?) evolution of Perl 5. Can Perl 5 break backward compatibility more than it does now? Maybe the questions should be: How much breakage is already too much?

   Tests are just more code, but when it gets to testing, even the best programmers might revert to the ancient art of copy-paste. But this is David Golden. He did not want to repeat his code so he wrote a module called Test::Roo to make it easy to use roles in testing. (And the comments are also interesting to read.)

   David Golden touched on a couple of issues regarding toolchain and testing: Minimum-supported Perl; Having a 'standard' for specifying pure-perl builds; Several new environment variables for testing contexts were added to make things clearer.

   I am not even sure this should be under the title 'testing' or 'business'. David Golden react to the posts written by Ovid advocating monitoring instead of testing. David brings us a lot closer to understanding the business rationals behind investing in more testing or eliminating some testing in favor of faster feed-back loop from the customers.

   There are cases when you would like to make sure your code runs on more than one version of Perl. Either because you don't have control over which version of perl will be used, or because your company wants to make sure when upgrade comes, it will be smooth. David Golden explains how he uses perlbrew to have several versions of perl on his system.

   Perl 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16, 5.18, and all their patch versions... There sure are a lot of perls out there. Even more if you play with the development versions. But thanks to perlbrew and cpanm, compiling a wide selection of them is fairly easy. David Golden walks us through the handful of scripts and tricks he uses to make managing the herd even easier.

   Especially interesting for CPAN authors who would like to read their POD in a web browser, before they upload the module to PAUSE. David Golden create a short script that would turn POD into HTML and then open your default browser to that file. Even if you don't need this service, the script is a nice example of using Path::Tiny, Pod::Simple::XHTML, and Browser::Open.

   David Golden checked the worst-case scenario, when you have a freshly installed perl and you need to install Dist::Zilla with more than 170 dependencies and suggests two ways to reduce the install-time. Even with those it will probably take more than 10 minutes. Just enough to do get up from your chair and do some exercises.

Basically, if you upload a distribution <code>Foo-Bar</code> to PAUSE, then it must contain a module <code>Foo::Bar</code>, otherwise it will not be added to the CPAN index. Existing dists not meeting this rule got an exception, but all new dists must satisfy this rule.

   David periodically publishes a chart that shows the dates of the Perl 5 stable releases; this one shows from 5.4 to the most recent 5.22. The thing that really stands out is the steady march of yearly releases from 5.12 onwards.

   David announced the first release candidate for the Perl MongoDB driver, version 1.0.0. This is a "substantial rewrite" of the original Perl driver, so if you use MongoDB, they'd like you to kick the tyres, and perhaps a little bit more.

   If you are using MongoDB, this is likely a module lying deeply into your stack. And its next release is going to be a big, scary, bump-it-to-one-dot-oh release. Wisdom says you might just want to give its trial version a whirl before things get irrevocable.

   David presents his solution to two of the things that bug him about PDFs of academic papers: humungous borders and missing metadata (making them hard to find later by search).

   MongoDB is one of the only next-gen databases to support Perl in-house. By providing feedback on how you use MongoDB you will help demonstrate the value this work provides. (I have filled the survey; ++ -ed the module; filed several JIRA tickets; Blogged about using MongoDB with Perl. The first two only take 1-2 minutes. The rest will need more involvement.  ~szabgab)

   Most people see Perl 5 and 6 as siblings. David goes further, and see them as Cain and Abel. Who happen to be Highlanders. Stuck in an infernal device created by the Jigsaw killer.

   It is very frustrating when you submit a pull-request and noone responds to it for a year. It is also very embarrassing when you realize you were the one who did not respond to a pull-request. Now, with the help of a little Perl script written by David you can see the whole list of repos where there are pull-requests waiting for your attention.

   The trial version of the upcoming Path::Tiny release is available. If you are using Path::Tiny, you should give it a whirl, as there are incompatible changes coming down the pipe. And if you are not using Path::Tiny. You should. 'cause it's awesome.
