   <a href="http://blog.sukria.net/2013/08/27/webkeepass-or-how-to-build-your-own-cloud-aware-keyring/">WebKeePass or how to build your own cloud-aware keyring</a><br>
   Do you us a single password on every system? If not, how can you remember all the passwords? Maybe you use KeePass to store them? Then how do you access them through a web browser? Alexis Sukrieh has a solution written, not surprisingly, in Dancer.

   <a href="http://blog.sukria.net/2014/09/03/the-art-of-interviewing-programmers-the-fizzbuzz-test-the-white-board-and-other-thoughts/">The art of interviewing programmers, the fizzbuzz test, the white board and other thoughts</a><br>
   Not exactly Perl specific, but Alexis Sukrieh has some good point for the interviewers. Of course if you are looking to be employed by a good firm, you might also want to read this to see the reasoning behind some of the interview questions and processes. For example: Who the hell needs to be able to program at a whiteboard?
