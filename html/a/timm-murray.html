   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/timm_murray/2013/05/announcing-uavpilot-v01.html">Announcing: UAV::Pilot v0.1</a><br>
   This is awesome! Timm Murray combined his favorite Camel herding language with a drone. (aka. Unmanned aerial vehicle). There is even a demo video!

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/timm_murray/2013/07/uavpilot-v05-released-now-supports-real-time-video.html">UAV::Pilot v0.5 Released, Now Supports Real Time Video</a><br>
   Would you like to spy on your neighbor? Now you can do that with your on drone controlled by Perl. Timm Murray continues his effort to connect Perl to the Parrot AR Drone with great success and with video images.

   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2013/08/29/underappreciated-perl-modules-filesharedir/">Underappreciated Perl Modules: File::ShareDir</a><br>
   Timm Murray from the Wumpus Cave started a series of articles covering modules that he feels are not as well known as they deserve to be. (Did someone say promotion here?) Anyway, in the first article he covered File::ShareDir that helps you distribute and then locate non-perl assets with your CPAN module. For example icons, templates, or data files you might need for your desktop or web application. Or for your unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2013/09/06/perl-modules-anyeventreadlinegnu/">Perl Modules: AnyEvent::ReadLine::Gnu</a><br>
   Ask any James Bond villain: building your drone army is only the first step. You also have to have an easy way to unleash them to do your bidding. In that optic, Timm Murray offers a way to control your favorite drones from the command line. Full history, tab-completion and cli goodness being all non-features, daaahling.

   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2013/09/09/underappreciated-perl-modules-treetrie/">What's a Trie, and Why Should You Care?</a><br>
   While probably you won't get a lot of daily usage out of this module it is certainly fascinating how Timm Murray from the Wumpus Cave explains the problems with associative arrays, (also known as hashes) and how Tree::Trie could solve all the problems. If we actually noticed that there are problems.
</li>

   2013.09.16 in <a href="/archive/113.html">#113</a>
   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2013/09/16/underappreciated-perl-code-testmoresubtest/">Underappreciated Perl Code - Test::More::subtest()</a><br>
   Maintaining the number of tests can be a real pain, and running tests in parallel can confuse the parser. Timm Murray from the Wumpus Cave shows how the subtest feature of Test::More can solve the former, and has an example how the latter might be solved.

   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2013/10/07/underappreciated-perl-code-taps-yamlish-syntax/">Underappreciated Perl Code: TAP's YAMLish Syntax</a><br>
   Parsing the error messages from a test script might be difficult as those include free text and were designed to be read by humans, not by computers. OTOH if you can get a well formatted version of this output then it will be possible and even easy to write a parser for them. This is what came out of the Wumpus Cave of Timm Murray.

   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2013/11/16/dont-get-bent-out-of-shape-about-being-cross-platform/">Don't Get Bent Out of Shape About Being Cross Platform</a><br>
   Timm Murray, who came out from the Wumpus Cave just to attend the MadMongers meeting, has his own opinion on how much one should invest in turning a script to be platform independent. Especially when there is no immediate need to run the script on other platforms.

   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2013/12/15/why-i-dont-like-perl-state-variables/">Why I Don't Like Perl State Variables</a><br>
   Have you ever used the 'state' keyword in Perl? It is 'new' since 5.10 and it works like a 'static' variable in C. But do you really need it? Timm Murray from Wumpus Cave does not seem to like it.
</li>

   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2013/12/28/uavpilot-v0-8-released-now-supports-wumpusrover/">UAV::Pilot v0.8 Released - Now Supports Wumpus Rover</a><br>
   The Wumpus Rover was built on top of an old RC car using a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino, and controlled by Timm Murray via his UAV::Pilot module. The article comes with a video, that was also featured on <a href="http://perltv.org/v/wumpusrover">the Perl TV</a>. If you are looking to build something by yourself, or with your kids, this can be a great project.

   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2014/03/12/perl-encryption-primer-the-importance-of-randomness/">Perl Encryption Primer: The Importance of Randomness</a><br>
   Timm Murray from the Wumpus Cave explains how rand() works and why it is not a good tool when security is important. He then goes on to suggest adding extra hardware if randomness is really important, or at least to use Crypt::Random.
</li>

<li>
   2014.03.19 in <a href="/archive/139.html">#139</a>
   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2014/03/19/perl-encryption-primer-one-time-pads-are-too-awesome-to-use/">Perl Encryption Primer: One Time Pads Are Too Awesome To Use</a><br>
   Timm Murray, a resident of the Wumpus Cave, explains what is a One Time Pad (OTP), how it is the perfect encryption system, and why we should never use it.
</li>

<li>
   2014.03.21 in <a href="/archive/139.html">#139</a>
   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2014/03/21/perl-encryption-primer-block-ciphers/">Perl Encryption Primer: Block Ciphers</a><br>
   Timm Murray writes about DES, the old standard for encryption, 3DES and Rijndael, also known as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The new standard that cannot be brute-forced.

   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2014/03/25/perl-encryption-primer-public-key-encryption/">Perl Encryption Primer: Public Key Encryption</a><br>
   In this part of his series, Timm Murray explains the RSA public key/private key encryption and message signing algorithm. He also provides a short explanation of what is NP (nondeterministic polynomial time), and why it is important for us.
</li>

   <a href="http://www.wumpus-cave.net/2014/03/27/perl-encryption-primer-hashes/">Perl Encryption Primer: Hashes</a><br>
   Hashes are one-way mappings of data to something more or less unique. Algorithms that you might have heard about include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, are implemented in modules in the Digest::* namespace. Timm Murray explains what are these hashing algorithms, when and how to use them, and what is the problem with birthday parties.

   No Perl code here, but now that the Wumpus Cave received a new QuadCopter, I am expecting lots of new Perl code and articles flying above our heads.

   <a href="http://perltricks.com/article/152/2015/2/11/A-Perl-Review-of-the-ODROID-C1">A Perl Review of the ODROID-C1</a><br>
   The ODROID-C1 is a competitor of the Raspberry Pi, a cheap "System on a Chip device". Timm Murray temporarily out of the Wumpus cave took a look at it from the perspective of a Perl developer.

   With the Raspberry Pi and other SoC (System on a Chip) devices it is time for Perl to start using accelometers. There aren't a lot of CPAN modules doing this, but Device::LSM303DLHC handling the LSM303DLHC chip can provide access to the readings. Let's see what can <b>you</b> do with it?
