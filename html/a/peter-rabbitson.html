   Peter Rabbitson (aka. ribasushi) shipped another version of DBIC, the best known ORM of perl, for testing. Hopefully the last beta. If you rely on DBIx::Class then you'd better test it now to avoid surprises later! If you are web-savvy could, you please help ribasushi to publish these announcements on the web site of DBIC? I'd much rather link to an 'officially looking' web page announcing this than an entry of a mailing list archive.

   I am not sure what happened to Ribasushi (aka. Peter Rabbitson), he was so against blogging. And now he failed too. But wait, he has actually got people to pay money for the privilege of drinking beer with him. Impressive.

   Ribasushi (aka. Peter Rabbitson) the leader of the DBIx::Class project provides a rare glimpse into the world of open source project management. The frustration, the doubt and and the hope. As it turns out, it is not just code. There are real people behind theses things.

   You might know that warnings can be changed to throw exceptions in a lexical scope. What you might not know is that some modules, that turn on 'use strict' - for example Moo, will also change the warnings into exceptions. I don't think the fear created in the title is warranted, but it is better to remind ourselves of this behavior. In any case, you can comment on the article to voice <b>your</b> frustration.

   Peter Rabbitson (aka. Ribasushi) embraced the current Perl Gittip movement, and argues how it can be a good way to give a nod to your favorite CPAN authors.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2014/02/please-join-gittip.html">Please Join Gittip</a><br>
   Gittip is a place where you can set up a regular weekly contribution to someone (probably an open source developer). Last week Peter Rabbitson called upon the Perl community to join Gittip and start giving a few dollars a week, this time it is Ovid. His point was that even just having Perl on the front page of Gittip will help Perl. Indeed his call brought Perl from the 19th place to the 10th place. I think we can do even better. The only thing you need to do is to join the 'Perl community' at Gittip. This is free. - Of course I'd go further and call upon you to start sending a few dollars a week.

   This is that time of the year again when Peter Rabbitson (Ribasushi) is getting ready for a new release of DBIx::Class and he wants to be sure it will work for you! So if you use DBIx::Class in an application, and especially if you have good test suite, then this is a very good time to test it with the upcoming release candidate.

   Are you a module authors? MetaCPAN can now drive visitors directly to the IRC channel where you provide support. Ribasushi explains what do you need to add to your META files in order to enable this feature.

   Ribasushi put forward an idea for a grant project: taking the lead on writing improved documentation for <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a>. He points out that this is not a minor undertaking.

   Ribasushi gave a lightning talk at YAPC:NA this year, and tweeted about the topic again this week. His message was: if there's something you don't like about a module, it's easy to let the author know by sending email to the RT mail alias. I thought it would be neat to have a bug email demultiplexor for CPAN, where we could email dist-name@bug.perl.org and it would check whether the dist has a specified bug tracker, using that if so, or RT otherwise. But Ribasushi pointed out that GitHub's T's &amp; C's don't allow this kind of automatic bug submission.

As a result he's going to step away from his CPAN distributions, but before he does there will be one last <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a> release.
