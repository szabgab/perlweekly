   Mark Allen has implemented the API of the Ge.tt file sharing service in both languages and praises CPAN and its tool-chain for making his life easier.

   Mark Allen shared his slides from the talk he gave at Houston.pm. Very nice slides and I love the title too. I am sorry we don't have the actual presentation. Maybe at YAPC::NA?

   <a href="http://byte-me.org/perl5-porters-weekly-2012-june-17/">Perl5-Porters Weekly: 2012 June 17-25</a><br>
   Mark Allen started a weekly report about the discussions on the Perl 5 porters mailing list. If you don't know, that's the list where people who maintain and develop the Perl compiler/interpreter discuss what they are working on, which features are added to perl and which are removed. If you don't have a lot of time but still would like to know what's planned for perl, this could be a very useful resource for you! In this entry, probably the most important news is the release of 5.17.1, the first developer snapshot for next year's release of 5.18. Try it.

   We are bit out-of sync with Mark Allen but it is not necessarily bad. There were some interesting threads on p5p mentioning bugs in Storable, overload, List::Util::first and that some highly illegal variable names are now accidentally legal.

   If you ever wondered why the official documentation of Perl still promotes a coding style that is rarely needed, and can lead to insecure code, there you can have the discussion about changing perlopentut. The other discussions seemed to involve much less drama.

   Finally, Mark Allen is back with his weekly reports from the Perl 5 Porters! You know, the people who improved perl. Yesterday, he published 4 monthly reports to catch up with what we missed (this is the latest of the 4), and now he will be back on track! Great!

   cpanfile allows you to describe the list of dependencies your module/application has and installing them using cpanm, without creating a CPAN distribution. This can be useful for new developers on GitHub, or inside corporations. See how Mark Allen explains it and then read the comments, including the ones from Miyagawa, who created the cpanfile format.

   You don't want perldoc to break your code, do you? Mark Allen is asking you to make sure the next release won't break it either.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/mark_allen/2015/06/netamazonec2-now-with-v4-signature-support.html">Net::Amazon::EC2 now with v4 signature support</a><br>
   Mark has uploaded a developer release of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Amazon::EC2">Net::Amazon::EC2</a> to CPAN with support for <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html">AWS4 signatures</a>. He's keen to get feedback from AWS users.
