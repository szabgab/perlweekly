   The CPAN testers are breaking their records every month now and helping CPAN Authors to discover and fix bugs in their modules. Even in Devel::Cover! Barbie who runs the sites provides us with updates, plans and a use-case.

   Barbie gave two talks at YAPC::EU: 'Smoking The Onion - Tales of CPAN Testers' and 'Perl Jam - How To Organise A Conference (and live to tell the tale)'. The latter is a book in progress you could help writing.

   Barbie (real name) has been writing about the hardware failure the CPAN Testers server encountered and how he was dealing with it. For several weeks it was mostly hard work but now finally we start to see real results showing up along with some analysis on how he handled some performance issues.

   Barbie has published the results of the surveys he ran for both ILPW and GPW. Based on this the two workshops were roughly the same size but the attendees of the German Perl Workshop were older, more experienced in Perl, contribute a lot more to the Perl community and like beer more. I wonder how does that compare to the London Perl Workshop?

A few weeks ago there was a post complaining about the CPAN Testers (I did not link to it as I don't like posts attacking other people.) Now Barbie, the main person behind the CPAN Testers explains everything you might want to know about CPAN Testers! Well, almost.
