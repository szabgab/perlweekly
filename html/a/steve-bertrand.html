   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/steve_bertrand/2017/06/ive-got-quite-a-few.html">List your dist's prereqs where newer versions have become available</a><br>
   Steve has written a module (and script) that will go through all modules by an author, and check their dependencies, to see if there's a newer version on CPAN than is required by the target module. You shouldn't automatically bumped the required version of your dependencies to the latest release, unless you're sure that your module really does require that release. Generally specifying a version is either to ensure a feature you rely on is available, or to avoid one or more bugs in earlier releases.

   When you upload a new version of your distribution, it is not enough to test that it still works on its own. It is also a good idea to test all the other distributions that depend on your code. Have you made an unplanned backward incompatible change that did not have a test?
