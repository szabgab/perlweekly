   Rob Lauer started to build a cloud-based business using Perl. This is the last entry in his series about building the business.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/rlauer/2013/06/perl-and-self-flagellation.html">Perl and self flagellation...</a><br>
   It seems this is the week of backlash against 'modern perl' as Rob Lauer has also posted his notes on why he prefers POP5 (plain old Perl 5) over 'modern perl'. Now I understand how 'self flagellation' and 'blessing' have some historical correlation, but I am not sure we really need to suffer in order to write code. Your mileage may vary.

   Bedrock, or OpenBedrock is a web development framework that allows you to embed SQL code in HTML. To me it looks like something left here from the previous century, but I am impressed that Rob Lauer, the author keeps running the project and keeps writing blog-posts about it!

   Rob shows how you can create one-time user session tokens in <a href="http://twiki.openbedrock.net/twiki/bin/view/Bedrock">Bedrock</a>, for example when someone has forgotten their password.

   PerlPan was designed to allow people to get feedback before the release a new module to CPAN. Is it still used?

   Rob wants to create a Perl Lambda in the AWS environment, but he needed to shave a few yaks for this. For example list all the dependencies (recursively) of a script or a module.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/rlauer/2019/01/perl-blogs.html">Perl Blogs</a><br>
   Rob is wondering what is the status of the new central blogging platform for Perl. There was no response (maybe because it is so hard to comment in the current bpo), but I don't think that should stop anyone from starting their own blog somewhere else. GitHub pages is a great and free way to write blog posts and Disqus can be used as a commenting engine or one could just link to a Reddit post where others could comment. Heck, one could even write a simple blogging engine in Perl 5 using AWS Lambda functions.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/rlauer/2019/01/aws-lambdas-furl-lwp.html">AWS Lambdas, Furl &amp; LWP</a><br>
   Amazon Lambda, aka. Serverless computing, allows you to create simple functions or complex applications, hand them over to Amazon and stop worrying about the number of servers you need to run. (Instead of that there are a lot of other fun things to worry about.) Anyway, up till now only a limited number of programming languages were supported and Perl was not one of them. Now thanks to Rob you can start to experiment with AWS Lambda using Perl 5 as well.
