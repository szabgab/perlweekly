   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/vyacheslav_matjukhin/2012/04/ubic---status-report.html">Ubic - status report</a><br>
   'Ubic is a polymorphic service manager which makes creating daemons easy, while being extensible in a several different ways' writes Vyacheslav Matjukhin after a long break in reporting about his module. He mixes a big dose of technical update with information on talks showing the project and ideas about reaching out to potential users. Not only Perl developers.

   Vyacheslav Matjukhin chose up a module - Validation::Class -, and provided his brain dump for what he understand and more importantly what he does not understand from the documentation. In this case he got very good response from the author - maybe because the author asked for his feedback? - and many of the problems and incorrect assumptions were fixed. I agree with the comments that we need more such interaction to improve our code and our documentation!

   Vyacheslav Matyukhin has started to work on an open source project. In his description it is a gamified todo-list and a social network for Perl developers. I don't yet understand what is really the objective of the project, but if you'd like to get involved in developing an open source web application, this might be a good opportunity. The technology behind it certainly sounds interesting: Perl Dancer, MongoDB, Twitter Bootstrap, Backbone.js and Ubic.

   Last week I mentioned the Play Perl project Vyacheslav Matjukhin started to build. I think in a very clever way he is now running a survey - a market research, if you wish - to understand how his project could help you. It is only a few minutes to answer the questions. I think it took me less than 2.

   You might remember I mentioned the survey that Vyacheslav Matyukhin runs as his market research. The result are in now with lots of histograms.

   What is that? I think it is a 'Quest based cooperative self-motivator'. Vyacheslav Matyukhin, the author, writes that it is a 'gamified platform for connecting and encouraging people'.

   Somewhere, the ghost of John Lennon is facepalming and muttering "shouldn't have said that, mate". But Vyacheslav Matyukhin has every reason to preen. Play-Perl first week has been a fantastic one, and the service sure caught the eye of many. Flash in the pan, or the birth of the next big thing? History will tell. But in the meantime, no-one can argue against the fact that, yeah, we could all use a little bit of play.

   Do you remember the Play Perl web site that was announced a few weeks ago? I found it as a great idea and I very happy to see Vyacheslav Matyukhin taking it one step further and trying to turn it into a business. It won't be easy. It is never easy, but I think people who are willing to take Perl back to the start-up scene doing a huge favor to the Perl community as well. They show that you can build great things for the 'end-user' with Perl and in the long run they create more demand for good Perl developers. Which is also great for those who prefer to be employed. Good luck!

   Questhub is a is a place where you can get psychological support that will help you do your volunteer work. You describe your quests, and then other users can comment on them, or 'like' them encouraging you to actually do what you set out to do. There are also so-called 'stencils' which are basically quest-templates. This is especially good if you'd like to contribute something to the Perl community, but don't know what. There are stencils to 'subscribe to the Perl Weekly', which you cannot do any more because you are already subscribed, but there many others that you can still pick up, and do.
