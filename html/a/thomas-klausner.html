   Thomas Klausner (domm) reports that he created a web site for the App::TimeTracker command line time tracker. I have to say they have a very cool demo on the front page and a very nice looking site. I find it very funny that the king of command line is building a nice web site for his command line product but I also find it very encouraging!

   The ultimate goal of computer science is, as we all know, to produce cool T-shirts. And blow minds.
