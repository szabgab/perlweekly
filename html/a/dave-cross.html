   <a href="http://perlhacks.com/2012/03/being-helpful/">Being Helpful</a><br>
   Dave Cross complains (?) about some people who did not like his recommendation to improve their Perl code. It is sad to see how some of the response got aggressive but I also often fall in the same trap as Dave fell: People, if they are not asking for help, will probably dislike the volunteer help we give. If we would like to improve their code we have to wait till they think they would like to improve. Without that it usually does not work.

   Dave Cross, the current maintainer of XML::Feed is calling on you to help improving this module. If I am not mistaken it is used by the Ironman and I am also using it to collect news items that end up (or not) in the Perl Weekly. It probably should use XML::Liberal as an optional back-end to be able to accept feeds that don't exactly adhere to the standard. Anyone with tuits?

   I am not sure if the original job ad was real or a joke. Or, maybe it was created so everyone will talk about it. Dave Cross uses this opportunity to tell us the short history of improvements in development practices he saw at his clients. First it was version control, then testing, and now continuous integration. I wish he was right, but I think he was just lucky.

   Dave Cross ran a free Perl course in London. This is his conclusion how it went and how he is going to improve, both the content, and the commitment from the students. IMHO charging money can create some commitment and makes people value the course more. Even if it is a small amount.

   This is basically an old proposal of Dave Cross to talk about the subject. Why are there companies in which management is blaming Perl for the lack of management in old Perl code? I asked there and I am still not sure, is this a problem specific to Perl? Is it a bigger problem for Perl than for other languages? Why?

   So part of Texinfo was ported from C to Perl that got some attention on Slashdot. Dave Cross checked the code and gave his opinion on how 'modern' that code is. I find both his comments and the reaction by the author of the code very interesting.

   There is a wealth of information coming in throughout the Perl groups on Linked In. They are very important to learn how people who use Perl but are not deeply connected to the CPAN developers use Perl. Dave Cross provide a bridge and in this article he tries to list the new features of Perl since 1995! Very valuable.

   Is Perl a secret weapon in Banks? Do any of them admit it? Can you find people who work at some of the largest money-making institutions that heavily rely on Perl.

   <a href="http://perlhacks.com/2013/12/misunderstanding-context/">Misunderstanding Context</a><br>
   It is always interesting to see when Dave Cross analyzes how people on the outskirts of the Perl community think about specific subjects related to Perl. I am not sure though, how would that look like like if people who are closer to the center of the onion explained what they know (or think to know) about these subject in Perl. I am sure I would be caught red-handed many times if I was writing about these.

   Every day Dave Cross encounters someone who want to solve some problem without installing any module from CPAN. Here he tries to explain why is that a broken idea. IMHO the problem is that many people 'in the Perl community' (see elsewhere) are busy showing why the others are wrong, instead of trying to understand the real reasons behind not wanting to deal with third-party modules.

Unfortunately that highlighted the fact that he has many modules that he has not interest maintaining and he is going to delete from CPAN. Or maybe its a good thing to make CPAN slimmer, but with a higher percentage of useful and maintained modules.
