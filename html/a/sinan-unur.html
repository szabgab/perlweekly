   In this post, Sinan Unur gives a beautiful example how Perl can help with unemployment. Or at least how you can use the HTML::TableExtract module to, well, extract tables from an HTML page. Also, I think posting beautiful examples of Perl solutions to actual problem is much better than complaining about bad examples.

   Sinan spotted a test in a widely used module that was meant to be checking one thing, but was checking something slightly different. A great example of why code reviews are a good idea.

   <a href="https://www.nu42.com/2015/12/perl6-newline-behavior-by-design.html">Perl6's newline conversion behavior seems to be by design</a><br>
   Sinan noticed that Perl 6's handling of newline characters, which has been mentioned in various blogs recently, can cause problems on Windows. This follows on from an <a href="https://www.nu42.com/2015/12/build-rakudo-star-perl6-visual-studio-windows.html">earlier post</a> where he hit the issue.

   Two weeks ago we include a <a href="https://www.nu42.com/2015/12/perl6-newline-behavior-by-design.html">post</a> from Sinan, where he pointed out some unexpected behaviour with handling of newlines in Perl 6. Sinan happily reports that it was fixed in time for Christmas.

   Sinan, the representative of the dark side with his Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 at hand took the new toy to a spin. It crashed and burned (what else would you expect from a butterfly hitting windows), but Sinan seems to be happy with the results.

   Sinan noticed that a certain distribution fails to install on Cygwin, and tracked it down to this: if a tar file has <code>foo</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>foo.exe</code>, then when you extract from the tar file you'll get <code>foo</code> but not <code>foo.exe</code>. See <a href="https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2009-08/msg00293.html">here</a> for example discussion.
