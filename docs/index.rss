<title>#517 - Commitment and habit</title>
<link>http://perlweekly.com/archive/517.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Flavio Poletti has just completed one year of blogging. Mohammad S. Anwar has been editing the Perl Weekly for more than three years and running the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for more than two years.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not sure what the secret is, but something about creating a commitment, even if it is an artificial commitment that then you need to stick to. I am sure both of them had times when they thought of sleeping in and not doing the work that day or that week. After all, this is not their paid job, but the commitment kept them going. With time it became easier to do the task and the whole thing became a habit. I wish more people found the strength to do something like this.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#516 - Conference in the Cloud</title>
<link>http://perlweekly.com/archive/516.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The highlight of last week was the Conference in the Cloud. It gave us the opportunity to meet and greet Perl and Raku fans from across the globe. On top of that, we got loads of quality talks by experts. Before I talk about anything else, let me thank and congratulate all the organisers and volunteers for such a successful event. I am personally impressed with the video quality of the live and recorded talks.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For me, I find the timing little bit odd as I am in the UK. The day started at 6:30pm British Summer Time, which is not ideal. At the end of a full day at $work, there is hardly any energy left to attend the talks live. But the best part wasthat the recorded talks were available on YouTube immediately. I find it convenient, as I can watch at my own time. Also I can fast-forward if I want to.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Please find below my personal favourites in no particular order.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#515 - Events and blog posts</title>
<link>http://perlweekly.com/archive/515.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;As I can see &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in the cloud&#x3C;/a&#x3E; starts tomorrow. I am a bit confused as don&#x27;t remember a lot of promotion of the event.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some people complain that the content created by the Perl Weekly Challenge has flooded the Perl Weekly Newsletter. I&#x27;d say if there was more Perl content outside of the PWC that we can share then we could consider reducing the amount of space the PWC takes up.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;BTW that reminds me, I think the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events.html&#x22;&#x3E;events&#x3C;/a&#x3E; page and the events section at the bottom of the newsletter is shrinkig as the event organizers rarely send updates. I guess having these links did not bring them visitors.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#514 - Is OOP bad?</title>
<link>http://perlweekly.com/archive/514.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;First things first, I am a big fan of OOP in general. However I do agree OOP is not always the best choice. Since Perl promotes the idea of TIMTOWTDI (There&#x27;s more than one way to do it), we have plenty of options to pick from. I have come across many Perl haters in the past complaining about lack of proper OOP support in Perl. With the introduction of postmodern object system for Perl, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose&#x22;&#x3E;Moose&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, we finally had structured OOP support. I must confess I prefer &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo&#x22;&#x3E;Moo&#x3C;/a&#x3E; which is known as minimalist object orientation.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Fast forward to now, Curtis Poe joined hands with other Perl masters and came up with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/Corinna-Overview&#x22;&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is proposed to be part of core Perl soon. I can&#x27;t wait for that to happen. I sincerely applaud the efforts of each and every contributor of Corinna. I beleive it will be the best addition to the Perl core in recent times. I am confident it will be the highlight of the future Perl7.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the last week &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/513.html&#x22;&#x3E;edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the weekly newsletter, Gabor reminded me that I forgot to celebrate the special &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/512.html&#x22;&#x3E;512th edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. What a shame, I missed the opportunity. I blame my busy routine for the missed opportunity. I am looking forward to my personal 100th edition of the weekly newsletter. This is the 79th edition for the record, not far off from the target.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Happy to see, the COVID-19 situation in India is getting better. I pray to ALLAH s.w.t for the complete protection from COVID-19. Please look after yourself and your loved ones.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;To all our readers in the UK, enjoy your bank holiday with the weekly newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>http://perlweekly.com/archive/513.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am disappointed. Mohammad does not like round numbers. He was editing both the 500th edition and the 512th edition and nothing. He did not even blink an eye. I hope he will not forget to celebrate the 1024 edition.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On another note, perl 5.34.0 was released.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not saying it is easy, but I really enjoy the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://code-maven.com/live&#x22;&#x3E;live pair programming sessions&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with Mark Gardner, Upasana Shukla, Juan J. Merelo, Erik Hulsmann, Ferenc Erki, Thomas Klausner, Ynon Perek people whom I know from the Perl community and also Shai Berger, Ivett &#xD6;rd&#xF6;g, Rachel Normand, Tally Barak, and Laia Asensio L&#xF3;pez, people I know from other places. One day you might also want to find a partner and try it. It is nice to work with other people who think differently from you.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Happy Idd to all the readers of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We should try to avoid all the negativity around us and focus on every little success story. I know it is not easy but we shouldn&#x27;t give up without a fight. Nowadays, social media platforms play a vital role in spreading news. So if you do come across any success story please share it with the community. It helps as morale booster.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I would like to specially mention two stories this week, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/newcomer-survey-results-actions&#x22;&#x3E;Andrew Solomon&#x27;s survey results and actions taken&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/dean/2021/05/a-perl-community-dashboard.html&#x22;&#x3E;Dean&#x27;s proposed community dashboard&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Kudos to Andrew and Dean for taking the initiative. Keep it up.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#511 - I am exhausted</title>
<link>http://perlweekly.com/archive/511.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There have now been more words spent on the improper way TPF in general and CAT in particular handled the abusive behavior than the decade-long harassment and abuse by - let&#x27;s keep to the tradition - Individual 1. Some of the lieutenants of the abuser demand evidence, but this is just a well known tactic for silencing them. As we all know abused and harassed people rarely speak up. Partially because they know the lieutenants will then try to discredit them and they will receive further harassment and abuse. I am not suprised that many people leave their active role in Perl or withdraw from certain parts of the Perl community and I am not surprised that most of them do it silently. After publishing this I fully expect the team will now restart harassing me as well or will just keep spreading lies about me.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This whole &#x27;discussion&#x27; is really exhausting and I can understand that most of the reasonable people will want to keep a distance from it. So let&#x27;s see what positive went on the last week and let me point out two:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The question &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/n5ceq1/anybody_hacking_on_anything_cool_this_week/&#x22;&#x3E;Anybody hacking on anything cool this week?&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the answers to it were excellent. This is what we need.  So do this: Write a 5-line entry on that Reddit-post or on &#x3C;a href&#x22;https://dev.to/t/perl&#x22;&#x3E;dev.to&#x3C;/a&#x3E; (or any other visible place) about a cool project you worked on in the last week. Then send the link to me!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/davorg/easier-web-sites-for-cpan-modules-1nn4&#x22;&#x3E;Easier web sites for CPAN modules&#x3C;/a&#x3E; project is another example of Dave Cross moving things forward. If you are a CPAN author, pick one of your modules and set up a website for it using this module. Then send me the link!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#510 - The Perl Community?</title>
<link>http://perlweekly.com/archive/510.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not sure if you have read the recent &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://neilb.org/2021/04/27/perl-communities.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by Neil Bowers. I have read it multiple times to understand the subject of the post. I must admit, I had never read such an in depth analysis of the term &#x22;Community&#x22;. As my vocabulary is rather limited, I found it very interesting to read such a long blog post. To me, community is group of like-minded people. When I attended my first London Perl Workshop, I immediately felt part of the community. The organiser and everybody was so accommodating and friendly. It made me come again the following year and I became addicted to it afterwards. I always looked up to the big names of the community everytime I needed some inspiration. Take a look at the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel/&#x22;&#x3E;past recipients&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the White Camel Award, you can get some idea of who&#x27;s who in the community. Unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t been awarded since 2018 for some reason that I am not aware of. I miss the community spirit of attending Perl Conferences. You can never experience that feeling unless you attend one. I hope and wish we get back to attending conferences. Although there has been virtual events in recent times, it can&#x27;t replace real events in my humble opinion. I must give credit to everyone who is keeping the community spirit alive.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is a bank holiday in the UK, so all the British readers of the newsletter, enjoy your break with the newsletter. Rest of the world, start your week with weekly doses of Perl news. Stay safe and healthy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#509 - Community Affairs</title>
<link>http://perlweekly.com/archive/509.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The Perl Foundation has posted two reports from the CAT, the Community Affairs Team. In one of them it was discussing actions taken agains two individuals. They don&#x27;t name the two people so I can only guess who they are. The links were posted to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Subreddit&#x3C;/a&#x3E; raising all kinds of claims agains it claiming that the TPF post is a personal attack on someone. Subsequently the post was removed from the Perl (Sub)Reddit.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was unclear to me if the complaints against the post were made by those who were (not) mentioned in the CAT report, their devoted friends, or just by people who think that being nasty on an ongoing basis to others is an acceptable behaviour, but talking about it and condeming it is not.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I had a tradition of posting a link to Perl Weekly to Reddit every time it was published. I am afraid this time I won&#x27;t be able to do it as this post will be considered a personal attack on some unnamed person who seems to be holy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As for me, for a long time I have not felt part of some &#x27;Perl community&#x27;. I try to serve the people who use Perl, I work with people for whom Perl is their main source of income. I like many of the people who are in and around what some might call the &#x27;Perl community&#x27;, but due to the behaviour of some individuals I also keep my distance. And frankly, I am sad.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, that&#x27;s it for now&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#508 - Perl Steering Committee (PSC)</title>
<link>http://perlweekly.com/archive/508.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The start of last week was terrible for all Perl fans. We found out that Sawyer had decided to step down from the Perl Steering Council and all other affiliates. At this time, when Perl is making a nice comeback, this came as quite a shocker. We need him now, more than ever, to be actively involved and take us to a new heights. Having said that, I do respect his decision and wish him all the best. I hope to meet him once again personally at some Perl conference.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We shouldn&#x27;t lose hope, though. Neil Bowers came up with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/04/msg259909.html&#x22;&#x3E;detailed plan&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that gave me confidence that we will bounce back.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have seen Sawyer regularly at London Perl Workshops but never got to speak to him. Then came a big moment of my life, I was giving my talk &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2017/talk/7209&#x22;&#x3E;Create tube map in 20 minutes using Map::Tube&#x3C;/a&#x3E; at the London Perl Workshops in 2017. Sawyer was the man behind the camera recording the talk. At the end of the talk, Sawyer came up to me and suggested how I could automate some of the tasks I mentioned in the talk. It was a big fan moment for me. Everything is still so fresh in my mind.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Apologies for the delay as this is first edition for me during the month of Ramadan. I wish all the readers a very happy Ramadan. May ALLAH s.w.t. protect us all from the evils. Amen.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
