<title>#637 - We are in shock</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/637.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some people compare the terrorist attacks in the south of Israel to 9/11, and compare the number of killed relative to the size of the country.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;However, I think there are some other, more shocking aspects of what happened, and to some extent is still happening here.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The Palestinian terrorists, whom are called &#x27;freedom fighters&#x27; by their supporters in the West, went from house to house, looked in the eyes of their victims and executed them. They looked in the eyes and murdered men, women, the elderly, and even children.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;They kidnapped 150 people, including an 85 years old women, several 5-8 years old children and even a 6 month old baby.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Israel is a small country (9.5 million people) with a lot of interconnected families. Each one of us either has a relative or personally knows someone who has a relative among the dead, kidnapped, or wounded. This is personal to us. This is personal to me.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am sure many of you are just as shaken as we are and some of you also ask what can you do?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I think you can follow some of the people who share information and share it with more people. For example &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoseph-haddad-a97a47198/&#x22;&#x3E;Yoseph Haddad&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and Israeli Arab who has been a clear voice for quite some time. (He also has Facebook and Instagram pages).&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As I am collecting the Perl-related articles and while I am writing this I hear the explosions as the Iron Dome takes down the rockets fired by the Palestinians to kill citizens in Tel Aviv. It is surreal. Unfortunately, this will be a bloody war with tens of thousands of casualties, but we will restore our security.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We don&#x27;t have any other choice.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#636 - Happy Birthday Larry</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/636.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A belated, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Happy Birthday&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to the creator of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. May the joy that you have spread in the past come back to you on this day. Just for record, the birthday was on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;27th September&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you use &#x3C;strong&#x3E;homebrew&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; did all the hard work to get &#x3C;strong&#x3E;homebrew&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; up to the latest &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are keen to know the details then please do &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/145939&#x22;&#x3E;checkout the pull request&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; recently shared his cool creation, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/oalders/is&#x22;&#x3E;is: an inspector for your environment&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am sure for all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;System Administrators&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; out there, it would be very handy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not sure, if you noticed this but &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmonks.org/&#x22;&#x3E;PerlMonks&#x3C;/a&#x3E; certificate expired few days ago. I only noticed as one of the contributor to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; shared link to the site. The very next day, I saw post by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; on Twitter talking about it and sharing the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.prettygoodping.com&#x22;&#x3E;tool&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that can help avoid such incident in future. The certificate has now been restored.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you know the current maintainer of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN Testers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; server?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I saw &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity/permalink/1538251906982430&#x22;&#x3E;Facebook post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mark Keating&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; just few days ago. I remember, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Doug Bell&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; helped many years ago when I was playing daily &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; upload games. He gave me access to deal with the issues I was facing at the time. I just hope, it stays live and kicking. It is the second best thing for us after &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are interested to sponsor the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then you now have plenty of different options. Please find out more about it in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://opencollective.com/metacpan-core&#x22;&#x3E;official announcement&#x3C;/a&#x3E; page.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For all newbies wanted to explore &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, please checkout the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.i-programmer.info/news/222-perl/16624-learn-perl-with-freecodecamp.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Programming Course&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;FreeCodeCamp&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Thank you &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Nikos Vaggalis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for sharing this with us.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The annual event, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hacktoberfest 2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is back.

<title>#635 - Is there a Perl developer shortage?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/635.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I just saw this question posted on DEV: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/devteam/is-there-a-developer-shortage-2l56&#x22;&#x3E;Is There a Developer Shortage?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. There were a few responses saying that there is an abundance of newbies and not very good engineers and there is a shortage in experienced and qualified engineers. That&#x27;s the general view. How is it specifically for Perl?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On a related note, I guess we are all wondering what will be the impact of the rise of AI in software development. My guess is that it will further widen the gap between beginners and experienced programmers. It will be even harder to get an entry level job as most of those tasks will be done by the AI powered developers, but the fixing the mess created by AI will require very highly qualified and experienced engineers.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On an unrelated note, I am ambivalent. On one hand as a content creator I&#x27;d like to be able to generate income from the articles I write, the videos I record. On the other hand, as a reader, I really don&#x27;t like Medium where you can read the beginning of an article and then you have to pay for the rest.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#634 - Perl v5.39.1</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/634.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Only recently we had a big bang release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;  with experimental &#x3C;strong&#x3E;class feature&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Now in a quick succession we have another release &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/release/SHAY/perl-5.39.1/view/pod/perldelta.pod&#x22;&#x3E;Perl v5.39.1&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Thanks to the entire team responsible for the release. These heroes work behind the scene for days/months for the improvement of the language. Yet, I rarely see anyone giving them credit on public platform. We should not just mention them in the pod but instead celebrate each one of them more on various public platforms. Having said, we need volunteer for the job. Do we have volunteer for the task?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Few days ago, I had an email from someone senior with lots of experience with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; saying &#x22;2023 is the year the language died for him&#x22;. I wonder how can someone just gave up on the language you loved all your life. For me personally, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; will remain my core strength and I will continue to improve my knowledge with every release. It is OK if you learn some new languages to be in the job market but please keep &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; your first choice.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yesterday, when I was done with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Asia Cup 2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; final cricket match between &#x3C;strong&#x3E;India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Sri Lanka&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I watched this documentary, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Hack&#x22;&#x3E;The Great Hack&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, on Netflix. It reminded me data is the new oil now a days. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is known to be good at data processing, so why are we behind others in this field?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;By the way, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; won the final for the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;8th time&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am so proud of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am now looking forward to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;World Cup 2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to be held in few months time in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#633 - Remember 9/11?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/633.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally I am back editing the weekly newsletter. As you all know I share the responsibilities with the chief editor, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I usually do the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;even&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; numbered weeks and he does the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;odd&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; ones. Having said, I was off the job for sometime because of health issues, I decided to take &#x3C;strong&#x3E;odd&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; numbered week i.e. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;633&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to make a comeback. From next week onwards, I will be back to the routine. I would like to take this opportunity to thank &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for all the help and support.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;9/11&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, people all around the world remember this day with different emotions. I still remember the event, I was sitting with my team in a small office in central London. Around lunch time local time, we got the news. The team was made up with Iraqi, Indian, Pakistani and English. So you can imagine the mixed reactions? For me, it is a very special day as I got married on this day &#x3C;strong&#x3E;20 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; ago. I choose this day so that I would never miss the most important day of my life.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Coming back to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I have been out of touch with it for the longest period. Thanks to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The [Perl|Weekly] Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I was holding the ground and stay in touch with the magical power of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There was a time, I used to be active and available to help anyone with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; related queries. With passing time, I find it hard to cope with the work load. I recently saw this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/olafalders_im-looking-to-pick-up-some-extra-weekend-activity-7105556888615858176-1BAB&#x22;&#x3E;post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It feels nice to see so much help available.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Post release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I saw jump in activities among the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans but there is still some not so positive vibes going around which makes me very sad. There is clearly two groups, one is very vocal in sharing personal opinions and the other is not so vocal but allow free speech. I happen to see both sides on daily basis and wish we had one platform where we can share our experience with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. This would have help sending one strong voice to the young generations and welcome to the community.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Recently concluded, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was a great event where I met so many young and enthusiastic members of the community. We should provide a common platform to these young bloods to come forward and share their experiences. They have so much knowledge, it is unreal. One evening, I spent with a twins brother having abundance of knowledge. Just talking to them gave me so much positive energy. On a funny note, it makes me realise I am getting old very quickly. Deep down, I would like to give back to the community that has been so welcoming. Having said, I have to be selective where I put my energy in. I keep getting invitations to be part of so many exciting things but I hardly find time for it. One thing, I would definitely do before I die is finish the book I started long time ago. It is primarily &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; focussed and I have a publisher, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, ready to help.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter and please do share your stories with us.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;My kids are not in school any more, but for those who have kids in school or who are themselves kids in school: good luck!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On a side note: yesterday &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8BeC922reo&#x22;&#x3E;I was interviewed&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on the weekly Ladino meeting called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://esefarad.com/tag/enkontros-de-alhad/&#x22;&#x3E;Enkontros de Alhad&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is in Ladino (Judeo Espanyol) and has nothing to do with Perl, but who knows, maybe you will find some parallel.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#631 - The Koha conference ended</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/631.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sorry for the late issue. As far as I know Mohammad is on his way back from vacation and I enjoyed a fun day at the dentist and now all I can eat is ice-cream. As Mohammad seems to take vacation seriously, even the Weekly Challenge report is missing this time. Anyway.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The 24 episode long blog series of Liz came to an end, and with that she said &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/lizmat/winding-down-mof&#x22;&#x3E;Goodbye to Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I remember meeting her first time some 20 years ago at a Perl conference. She was always very nice. Good luck with your work on Raku!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am also glad Thomas Klausner went to the Koha-conf as we now have a nice, green and yellow &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://domm.plix.at/perl/2023_08_things_i_learned_at_perlkohacon.html&#x22;&#x3E;report&#x3C;/a&#x3E; about it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#630 - Vacation time</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/630.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hello there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It&#x27;s me, Gabor again as Mohammad is on vacation in India. Actually I am also on a semi-vacation in Hungary. I work some, but most of the time I spend with friends. So you are stuck with me again. This is not that bad as I can further explain what I meant last week.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Apparently I did not explain myself properly in the previous edition. I don&#x27;t intend to include rather random articles about other languages in the Perl weekly, but I will not totally refrain from them either. I will mention my non-Perl training courses if I think they might be relevant to some of you.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some people suggested that I pass on the whole Perl Weekly to &#x27;the community&#x27;. I don&#x27;t think there is anyone (maybe except of Mohammad) who would want to take over the whole newsletter. I guess if anyone was interested, s/he would have already offered to be part of the editorial staff. Let&#x27;s make this also an invitation: if you think you&#x27;d like to edit the newsletter once in a while then let me know.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On another note, if you are using Facebook, I&#x27;d like to remind you that the recommended Perl group is the one called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl Community&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In any case, enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#629 - Are we afraid of other languages?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/629.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Once in a while when I share something that is not Perl related I get some negative comments. Occasionally even some hate-speech or abusive messages. It&#x27;s not pleasant, but I hear from others who publish stuff, that they get such messages too. In some cases a lot more than I do. So I guess it is part of the deal. I might have some more impact on the life of people by having this platform and some people hate me for that. The question, what shall I do with my &#x27;platform&#x27;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some people think the Perl Weekly and even me as an individual should only care about Perl. They say: If people see that the chief editor of the Perl Weekly talks about other programming languages then that&#x27;s going to ruin Perl. It&#x27;s pretty laughable as most of the other weekly newsletters are owned by a single person who runs them as a business.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anyway, I recall in the early 2000s we had a very active Perl Mongers group in Israel called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.org.il/&#x22;&#x3E;Israel.pm&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that I lead. At one point we started to have a &#x27;foreign languages&#x27; track in which we showed each other various other programming languages. I recall once I gave a presentation about Dart. We also had presentations about Tcl, Ruby, and Python. We were not bothered by that. At one point I even started to joke that in Perl There&#x27;s More Than One Way To Do It, one of them is Python.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Unfortunately I did not pick up Python early enough and did not start to offer Python training early enough. As most of my clients started to switch to Python they found other trainers who offered Python courses. By the time I realized I need to diversify it was too late. Most of my clients were gone and getting back them is rather difficult as they already have a trainer they are satisfied with.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Which brings me to a question I ask myself: Should the Perl Weekly be exclusively about Perl serving the interest of the language, or should it serve the interest of the people on the newsletter? I think we need to strike a balance. Mostly providing Perl-related content, but also provide some pointers for people who understand that they too might need to look elsewhere in order to find a source of income. I don&#x27;t want to give the message that is an either-or. IMHO for everyone it is totally fine to work in other programming languages and keep Perl as a hobby if that&#x27;s what life brings.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;To me it seem that the use of Rust will grow and thus it is a good time to learn about it and to start to offer training courses in it. So let me remind you that starting in September I am going to run a Zoom-based Rust course. If you are interested, let me know in an email!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#628 - Have you tried Perl v5.38?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/628.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Ever since the release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I have been thinking of playing with it but never got anything interesting to work on. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Chris Prather&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is taking the lead to my knowledge, sorry if I missed anyone else. You can checkout the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-0.html&#x22;&#x3E;Part 0&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-1.html&#x22;&#x3E;Part 1&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-2.html&#x22;&#x3E;Part 2&#x3C;/a&#x3E;,,&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-3.html&#x22;&#x3E;Part 3&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-4.html&#x22;&#x3E;Part 4&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-5.html&#x22;&#x3E;Part 5&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-6.html&#x22;&#x3E;Part 6&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. We should all be gratefull that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Chris&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is making an effort to showcase the power of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I would also like to mention another name, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Renee Baker&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, who shared his encounter with the latest release in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blog.perl-academy.de/2023-08-01-ein-groaer-klassenunterschied-class&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, originally written in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; but I used browser translate feature to read in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;English&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Kudos to their efforts for sharing the knowledge with us. I applaud their dedications and love for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;One of core team member, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Steven Little&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; started project, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/stevan/Stella&#x22;&#x3E;Stella&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, using the latest release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It also reminded me a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://ovid.github.io/blog/politics-in-programming.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; shared &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 years ago&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I still find it very usefull and handy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Have you done anything with Perl v5.38?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If yes then please do share with us so that we can make it public here with the community. In &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2021&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I shared the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Design Pattern&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; implementation using &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo&#x22;&#x3E;Moo&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and family in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/Design-Patterns&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. With so much happenings with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I tried to re-implement &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/Design-Patterns/tree/master/00-class-feature/01-singleton&#x22;&#x3E;Singleton&#x3C;/a&#x3E; just for fun using the new experimental feature &#x3C;strong&#x3E;class&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I will see what else I can do next with the limited features we have in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook and Perl ...&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As most of you know, we have two very active &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook groups&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; primarily dedicated to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; language i.e. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl Community&#x3C;/a&#x3E; managed by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Programmers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; managed by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Will Braswell&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Fortunately, I am one of the moderators for both &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; groups in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Of the two groups, one is private and the other is public. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the chief editor of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl weekly&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; newsletter, joined the Facebook group with much fanfare. Everyone welcomed him with open hands. I was happy to see him sharing his valuable ideas with the group members. Last week &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/627.html&#x22;&#x3E;newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; editorial created so much noise that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; decided to leave the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Programmers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; group. Only recently we &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1H9yKf8BI0&#x22;&#x3E;heard&#x3C;/a&#x3E; from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Sawyer X&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; about the abuse he received and how he decided to stay away from any future &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl meetups/conferences&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. What a loss to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Community&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in general. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; also left the group in the similar fashion but luckily he is still active. If we start loosing stalwarts like this then very soon we will not have anyone to lookup for advice/guidance.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am writing this editorial midweek (Thursday night) as I am flying to India on Friday morning. By the time you get this newsletter, I would be in India. I will checkout the response on social media platform. Let us all try to create friendly space where everyone is welcome.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter and stay safe.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
