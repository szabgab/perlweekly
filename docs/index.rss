<title>#521 - Floods in Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/521.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This week we saw the tremendous and devastating power of nature in Europe as well. The Guardian even mentioned the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/16/western-germany-floods-angela-merkel-horror-catastrophe-deaths-missing-search-flooding-belgium&#x22;&#x3E;Moselle River at Perl in Germany&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. The place where Liz and Wendy attempted to re-unite the Perl 5 and Perl 6 communities as well. That was not very successful.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I was wondering what can we do?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I know a few members of the Perl community who are also volunteer firefighters. Some of them might have taken part in the rescue efforts maybe even risking their own lives. That a very generous way of helping others and helping the world when disaster strikes.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I know a few other members of the Perl community who make an effort to reduce their own carbon footprint by traveling by bike and train only. That can help postpone the disasters and if enough people do them might even prevent the disasters.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What do you do? What examples could we follow to help when disaster strikes? What could ew do to try to avoid the disasters in the first place? Write about it in a blog and send the link to me!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#520 - CPAN Bus Factor</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/520.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If, like me, you are a fan of MetaCPAN then you must have noticed the latest changes to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E; site. It is the introduction of new metric, &#x22;CPAN Bus Factor&#x22;. Don&#x27;t know what I am talking about? Well then you should read the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.olafalders.com/2021/06/30/cpan-bus-factor/&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, which is a collaborative work by Neil Bowers and Olaf Alders.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It reminds me an incident from the past when I received an email from Neil Bowers about one of my CPAN distribution, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/IP::Info&#x22;&#x3E;IP::Info&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as he was reviewing CPAN modules for locating an IP address. Later he published his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://neilb.org/reviews/ip-location.html&#x22;&#x3E;report&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on 8th Aug 2012. You can take a look collection of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://neilb.org/reviews/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN module reviews&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by him. If my memory serves, Neil also ran &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://cpan-weekly.org/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Weekly&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, for a while. I did join the mailing list and the received CPAN Weekly newsletter talking about a CPAN module and its usage every week. Unfortunately it is no longer active.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A long time ago, I used to be an active CPAN contributor. Unfortunately, because of time constraints, I&#x27;m no longer as active as I used to be. I even wrote a two-part blog post on the subject - &#x22;How to become a CPAN contributor?&#x22; - for perl.com in 2018. You can check out the posts, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor/&#x22;&#x3E;Part 1&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor-part-2/&#x22;&#x3E;Part 2&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, if you are interested.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Why am I talking about CPAN contributions?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A friend of mine and fellow contributor to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, Cheok-Yin Fung, wrote a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/c_y_fung/2021/07/how-i-uploaded-a-cpan-module.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog&#x3C;/a&#x3E; about her experience of uploading her first distribution to CPAN. It reminds me of my early days of struggle with CPAN. These days there is a lot of help available on various public platforms. I wish her all the best and welcome to the club of CPAN contributors.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I came across a very interesting &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://medium.com/codex/how-to-create-awesome-pull-requests-b634e7f00e47z&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by JJ Merelo talking about Pull Request do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts. Very helpful advice for anyone looking to contribute to open source projects in general.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#519 - Crystal conference and course</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/519.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am going to give a presentation at the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://crystal-lang.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Crystal&#x3C;/a&#x3E; 1.0 &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://crystal-lang.org/conference/&#x22;&#x3E;conference&#x3C;/a&#x3E; alongside Yukihiro &#x27;Matz&#x27; Matsumoto and Bruce Perens (just to throw in two names you might be familiar with and to have some honor by association). It is taking place this Thursday. It is my first presentation at an international conference for a long time. Wish me luck!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you cannot make it to the conference, but you are interested in learning Crystal, I am going to start an experimental programming Crystal course via Zoom. You can &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://code-maven.com/crystal-course&#x22;&#x3E;get more information and register here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As for Perl, it was a rather quiet week without a lot of posts, but still there is some nice stuff in here&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#518 - Becoming book author?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/518.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I recently came across a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://davecross.substack.com/p/the-story-of-ebooks-and-me&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by Dave Cross where he shared the story of how he got into publishing ebooks. I highly recommend you read his blog post, I find it inspirational, personally. I always wanted to write a technical book on a subject related to Perl. I have high regard for those who are professional authors e.g. Curtis Poe, brian d foy, Gabor Szabo, Dave Cross and many more. Ever since I started the weekly challenge, I became more involved in writing technical blogs. Soon I realised it is not the same as writing a technical book. But the urge inside me to become an author didn&#x27;t die forever. With Dave&#x27;s recent blog post fanning the idea once again, I became charged one more time but this time I am seriously thinking about it. I have a topic that I wanted to explore for some time. I discussed it with Gabor and Dave and got very positive responses. So it is official I am now working on my first book, soon to be published by Dave Cross. Fingers crossed. Life is so beautiful when you have friends like Gabor and Dave who always encourage and guide you.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is another story that I would like to share. Andrew Shitov reached out to me few days ago to ask if I was interested in sharing my Raku story at the upcoming &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://conf.raku.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Raku Conference&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I have accepted his offer and am working on my presentation. I haven&#x27;t submitted my talk yet but will do so soon. Do you have a Raku story to share? If yes, then please do submit your talk before the deadline.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;One last story for the week and then I will go away. Many of you know that I have been running the Perl Weekly Challenge for more than 2 years now. It started as a weekly challenge aimed for Perl and Raku community but soon it spread out to other languages. As of today, we now have received contributions in over 50 different languages. Latest addition is the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://code-maven.com/crystal-binary-palindrom&#x22;&#x3E;Crystal programming language&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by none other than Gabor Szabo himself. A long time ago, someone (I don&#x27;t remember who), suggested that I should register a generic domain instead of perlweeklychallenge.org. I didn&#x27;t waste any time and registered the new domain theweeklychallenge.org. Having registered the new domain, I didn&#x27;t have the courage and expertise to switch over the actively used live site to another domain. I asked about this on Facebook and guess what? Dave Cross came up with step-by-step guide explaining how to do the domain switch. I was still very nervous to take the risk. Then came the final blow with Gabor asking the same question: why don&#x27;t I move domain to a generic domain. To cut a long story short, Gabor and I spent an hour or so yesterday (Sunday afternoon) and got the domain switched over. So we now have new domain the weekly challenge: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;theweeklychallenge.org&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Thank you Gabor and Dave for all the support and guidance.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#517 - Commitment and habit</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/517.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Flavio Poletti has just completed one year of blogging. Mohammad S. Anwar has been editing the Perl Weekly for more than three years and running the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for more than two years.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not sure what the secret is, but something about creating a commitment, even if it is an artificial commitment that then you need to stick to. I am sure both of them had times when they thought of sleeping in and not doing the work that day or that week. After all, this is not their paid job, but the commitment kept them going. With time it became easier to do the task and the whole thing became a habit. I wish more people found the strength to do something like this.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#516 - Conference in the Cloud</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/516.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The highlight of last week was the Conference in the Cloud. It gave us the opportunity to meet and greet Perl and Raku fans from across the globe. On top of that, we got loads of quality talks by experts. Before I talk about anything else, let me thank and congratulate all the organisers and volunteers for such a successful event. I am personally impressed with the video quality of the live and recorded talks.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For me, I find the timing little bit odd as I am in the UK. The day started at 6:30pm British Summer Time, which is not ideal. At the end of a full day at $work, there is hardly any energy left to attend the talks live. But the best part wasthat the recorded talks were available on YouTube immediately. I find it convenient, as I can watch at my own time. Also I can fast-forward if I want to.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Please find below my personal favourites in no particular order.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#515 - Events and blog posts</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/515.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;As I can see &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in the cloud&#x3C;/a&#x3E; starts tomorrow. I am a bit confused as don&#x27;t remember a lot of promotion of the event.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some people complain that the content created by the Perl Weekly Challenge has flooded the Perl Weekly Newsletter. I&#x27;d say if there was more Perl content outside of the PWC that we can share then we could consider reducing the amount of space the PWC takes up.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;BTW that reminds me, I think the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events.html&#x22;&#x3E;events&#x3C;/a&#x3E; page and the events section at the bottom of the newsletter is shrinkig as the event organizers rarely send updates. I guess having these links did not bring them visitors.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#514 - Is OOP bad?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/514.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;First things first, I am a big fan of OOP in general. However I do agree OOP is not always the best choice. Since Perl promotes the idea of TIMTOWTDI (There&#x27;s more than one way to do it), we have plenty of options to pick from. I have come across many Perl haters in the past complaining about lack of proper OOP support in Perl. With the introduction of postmodern object system for Perl, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose&#x22;&#x3E;Moose&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, we finally had structured OOP support. I must confess I prefer &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo&#x22;&#x3E;Moo&#x3C;/a&#x3E; which is known as minimalist object orientation.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Fast forward to now, Curtis Poe joined hands with other Perl masters and came up with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/Corinna-Overview&#x22;&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is proposed to be part of core Perl soon. I can&#x27;t wait for that to happen. I sincerely applaud the efforts of each and every contributor of Corinna. I beleive it will be the best addition to the Perl core in recent times. I am confident it will be the highlight of the future Perl7.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the last week &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/513.html&#x22;&#x3E;edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the weekly newsletter, Gabor reminded me that I forgot to celebrate the special &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/512.html&#x22;&#x3E;512th edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. What a shame, I missed the opportunity. I blame my busy routine for the missed opportunity. I am looking forward to my personal 100th edition of the weekly newsletter. This is the 79th edition for the record, not far off from the target.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Happy to see, the COVID-19 situation in India is getting better. I pray to ALLAH s.w.t for the complete protection from COVID-19. Please look after yourself and your loved ones.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;To all our readers in the UK, enjoy your bank holiday with the weekly newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am disappointed. Mohammad does not like round numbers. He was editing both the 500th edition and the 512th edition and nothing. He did not even blink an eye. I hope he will not forget to celebrate the 1024 edition.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On another note, perl 5.34.0 was released.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not saying it is easy, but I really enjoy the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://code-maven.com/live&#x22;&#x3E;live pair programming sessions&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with Mark Gardner, Upasana Shukla, Juan J. Merelo, Erik Hulsmann, Ferenc Erki, Thomas Klausner, Ynon Perek people whom I know from the Perl community and also Shai Berger, Ivett &#xD6;rd&#xF6;g, Rachel Normand, Tally Barak, and Laia Asensio L&#xF3;pez, people I know from other places. One day you might also want to find a partner and try it. It is nice to work with other people who think differently from you.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Happy Idd to all the readers of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We should try to avoid all the negativity around us and focus on every little success story. I know it is not easy but we shouldn&#x27;t give up without a fight. Nowadays, social media platforms play a vital role in spreading news. So if you do come across any success story please share it with the community. It helps as morale booster.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I would like to specially mention two stories this week, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/newcomer-survey-results-actions&#x22;&#x3E;Andrew Solomon&#x27;s survey results and actions taken&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/dean/2021/05/a-perl-community-dashboard.html&#x22;&#x3E;Dean&#x27;s proposed community dashboard&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Kudos to Andrew and Dean for taking the initiative. Keep it up.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
