<title>#626 - What is Oshun?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/626.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am sure you have followed &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2023 in Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; whether as attendee or &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/@YAPCNA/videos&#x22;&#x3E;watching the videos&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I was fortunate to attend the conference and meet the who&#x27;s who of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Community&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The highlight of the conference for me was the keynote, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT0S-jfO1mE&#x22;&#x3E;Coming soon ...&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, presented by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It was during the keynote, we were introduced to a new project, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl-Oshun/oshun&#x22;&#x3E;Oshun&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Since the release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, we have all been introduced to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, a modern OO to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; core. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Oshun&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is the next big thing after &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. To be honest, it is really cool idea and I can&#x27;t wait it to be included in the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; core. I know it is in early stage right now but I am glad it is in safe hand.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I would also like to mention about another talk &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1H9yKf8BI0&#x22;&#x3E;No one is immune to abuse&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Sawyer X&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was lucky enough to be in the audience. In general, we are proud of the friendly and encouraging nature of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; community but it is also fact that you do come across few who are not too friendly. I could relate to what was shared in the talk as I have experienced the abuse myself during the early days of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;[The/Perl] Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I must confess it took me months to recover from it. Those who are part of the weekly challenge must have noticed it too. I stopped participating in the weekly challenge for sometime and kept myself limited to managing the challenge as opposed to contributing to the weekly challenge in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, writing &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs&#x22;&#x3E;blog posts&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and making &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube videos&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for the same. I did come back few months later and participated again but it didn&#x27;t last long.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you missed the conference this year then you have plenty of time to book your place at &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E; which is going to be held in sunny &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Las Vegas, Nevada&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We also had surprise announcement by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; with regard to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cfp.perladvent.org&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2023 CFP&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I missed the deadline last year and couldn&#x27;t find a place in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2022&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2022&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I will make sure this time, I submit my proposal well before the deadline. If you have something to share with the rest of the community then I would request you to come forward and submit your proposals.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not the least, the next big event, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlkohacon.fi&#x22;&#x3E;Perl and Koha Conference 2023&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is happening next month. You can find the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlkohacon.fi/Schedule.html&#x22;&#x3E;schedule&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the event. I am going to miss the event as it is clashing with my home visit to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I hope and wish you all have great time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Thank you &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabod&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for the space in the editorial of last week &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/625.html&#x22;&#x3E;newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It means a world to me. Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#625 - Mohammad Sajid Anwar the new White Camel</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/625.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Let me start by congratulating Mohammad Sajid Anwar, my fellow editor of the newsletters, for receiving the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://whitecamel.org/&#x22;&#x3E;White Camel Award&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Mohammad, you certainly deserved it!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As it turns out the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://whitecamel.org/&#x22;&#x3E;White Camel web site&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is still served from my GitHub Account. I updated it now adding the most recent recipients. I also updated the README in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/whitecamel.org&#x22;&#x3E;repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. There are several TODO items. It would be really awesome if you could help me with the site. If you don&#x27;t know how, then join me in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://osdc.zulipchat.com/&#x22;&#x3E;OSDC chat&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and we can discuss it there.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;You might remember I used to teach a lot of Perl courses, but then unfortunately that market dried up. I did run a remote training course in 2020 about testing in Perl, but not much else. The pandemic also did not help much with training. Oh yeah, at the beginning of the year I ran an instance of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://osdc.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Open Source Development course&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with focus on Perl. The video recordings are &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://osdc.code-maven.com/osdc-2023-01-perl/&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. However, I am starting to offer my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;corporate training courses&#x3C;/a&#x3E; again. It would be great to teach Perl again, but even if it is &#x27;only&#x27;, Git or GitHub it will be still fun.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Lastly for today: The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlkohacon.fi/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl and Koha conference&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is going to place August 14-18, 2023, Helsinki, Finland. You still have a month to get there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#624 - TPRC 2023</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/624.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;By the time you read this newsletter, I would be on the flight to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to attend &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc2023.sched.com&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2023&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I hope and wish to meet many experts and learn from their experience.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/622.html&#x22;&#x3E;issue 622&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I mentioned that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is coming soon. Then a week later, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; announced the arrival of latest release in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/623.html&#x22;&#x3E;issue 623&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I was pleasantly surprised by the early release. I would like to take this opportunity and thank all involved in the release. Special mention to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and his team for the work on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. To me it is one of the most anticipated feature. To me, it is not just another release but a very special one. Therefore I was expecting it to be the talk of the town. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t come across any such noise. In fact, the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was more discussed on various social platform. I even collected my experiment with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As of today, the latest release is one week old and I finally managed to install it on my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Windows WSL (Ubuntu 20.04)&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Plan is to extend the above mentioned repository and record my experiment with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have recorded the installation steps in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://gist.github.com/manwar/868aeb07ef4b445b55f726b02a79544d&#x22;&#x3E;gist&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, if you are interested.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For all the German speaking readers, we have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blog.perl-academy.de&#x22;&#x3E;blog posts&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with the regard to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Renee Baecker&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Talking about blog post, we have another &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://ovid.github.io/articles/corinna-in-the-perl-core.html&#x22;&#x3E;detailed post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by the lead designer of Corinna, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I would also like to mention another name here, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Andrew Shitov&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, mostly known for his work on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, sharing his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://andrewshitov.com/2023/07/06/built-in-classes-in-perl-5-38&#x22;&#x3E;solution&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to the task &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-224/#TASK1&#x22;&#x3E;Special Notes&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Week #224&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; using the new &#x3C;strong&#x3E;class feature&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Who owns the Camel logo?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well it is long outstanding issue, so much talked about it but unfortunately nothing happened so far. I just hope and wish it gets resolved soon. I came across this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/open-letter-to-tim-oreilly-to-free-the-perl-camel-k3i&#x22;&#x3E;Open Letter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Thibault Duponchelle&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#623 - perl v5.38.0 was released</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/623.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Good news. The new version of perl is out, just in time to be included in this edition. See the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2023/07/msg266602.html&#x22;&#x3E;announcement&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/release/RJBS/perl-5.38.0/view/pod/perldelta.pod&#x22;&#x3E;perldelta&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for changes. If I understand correctly the bigges change by far is the addition of the &#x3C;b&#x3E;class&#x3C;/b&#x3E; keyword. There are also a number of deprecations you will want to pay attention to. If you&#x27;d like to take it for a ride you can find the instruction &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.cpan.org/src/README.html&#x22;&#x3E;how to install perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. You can also use &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlbrew.pl/&#x22;&#x3E;perlbrew&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to install it. I hope we&#x27;ll soon have a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://strawberryperl.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Strawberry Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; release as well.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week I asked two questions on various forums:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If someone asks you why contribute to open source? What do you say?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you don&#x27;t contribute to any open source project, what stops you from contributing?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;ve collected some of the responses at the bottom of the page: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://osdc.code-maven.com/why-contribute-to-open-source&#x22;&#x3E;Why contribute to open source&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As Mohammad already mentioned last week, I&#x27;ve set up a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://zulip.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Zulip&#x3C;/a&#x3E;-based chat server for people who would like to get help on their path to contributing to open source. In this community I we&#x27;ll be able to support contributors in several programming languages. We started with Perl, Python, and Rust. You are &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://osdc.zulipchat.com/&#x22;&#x3E;invited&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/622.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally I am back to editing the weekly newsletter. Thank you &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for all the supports and kind words. I would also like to thank all the weekly newsletter readers for sending the sweet message. Never thought it would affect me so much, honestly speaking.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Although I am staying away from screen most of the time, I did see lots of activities by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I wish I could help him in his work. If you are interested then you can read about the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://osdc.code-maven.com/community&#x22;&#x3E;Open Source Development Community&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and help him on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://osdc.zulipchat.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Zulip&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have been waiting for the final release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. However I am very happy to see at least we got the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/release/RJBS/perl-5.38.0-RC2&#x22;&#x3E;RC2&#x3C;/a&#x3E; out in public.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you know what is in Perl v5.38?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;You can find the details in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org/blead/perldelta&#x22;&#x3E;perldelta&#x3C;/a&#x3E; page. For me, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is going to be the highlight of the new release. However I am told not to have high expectations about it in this release. Still, I am excited to at least play with it and have fun.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I had almost forgot about participating &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.to/tprc-2023-tor/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2023&#x3C;/a&#x3E; because of what I have gone through in the last few weeks and still going on. But the best part is, I have booked everything from air ticket to hotel reservations. Having said, I still have to get the slides ready for the my talk about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you are planning to attend the conference then please do come and see me. I would love to meet as many Perl enthusiasts as I can. I am mostly looking forward to meet the weekly challenge members. I got exactly &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 weeks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; time to get everything sorted before it is too late.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not the least, please do checkout the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.olafalders.com/2023/06/05/docker-fix-perl-test-failure&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; where he shared his encounter with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Docker&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to fix a Perl v5.37 error.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Mohammad even though he kept handling &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, skipped the previous edition of the Perl Weekly because he was attending his father who was in a very bad health condition. A couple of days ago he posted on Facebook that his father passed away. Mohammad, let me send you my condolences and my hugs here, through the Perl Weekly as well!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;OSDC: As you might know I have been using this acronym for a while to stand for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://osdc.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Open Source Development Course&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but I have already seen it used where the C stood for Conference (I even organized one of those), and where the C stood for Club. The goal in all of these cases is to Contribute to open source. (another potential for the letter C).&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I recently joined a club, well, it is basically a Discord server, where Israeli developers help each other get involved in open source. The basic idea is very similar to what I have been talking about for years now: One of the ways for newbies (or juniors) to gain experience and increase their chances to find a job is to work on open source projects. I am really glad that someone created it. There are already more than 600 members. In this group the main conversation language is Hebrew so if you can read and write in Hebrew and if you are interested to join let me know and I&#x27;ll send you the invite link.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I would be also very interested to know if there are other, similar local groups using their own local language elsewhere and if you are familiar with other such clubs that are maybe focused on a specific programming language or maybe a specific project? Links are welcome to my email address!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#620 - Abandoned modules?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/620.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Mohammad asked me to the edition this week as well, so now you are stuck with me. Again :)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week I wrote about my offer to companies to help with the maintenance of open source Perl (and Python) libraries they rely on. One of the responses I got was from someone who wanted to help with abandoned modules in his free time. He asked me which modules are abandoned?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_operating_model&#x22;&#x3E;PAUSE operating model&#x3C;/a&#x3E; mentions 3 special owners that can help identify modules that are up for adoption or otherwise need help. You can see the lists here: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/ByMaintainer.html?Name=ADOPTME&#x22;&#x3E;ADOPTME&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/ByMaintainer.html?Name=HANDOFF&#x22;&#x3E;HANDOFF&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/ByMaintainer.html?Name=NEEDHELP&#x22;&#x3E;NEEDHELP&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;More details can be seen on the CPANMeta site: for example for the modules owned by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpanmeta.grinnz.com/perms?author=ADOPTME&#x26;module=&#x26;match_mode=exact&#x22;&#x3E;ADOPTME&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Another type of listing can be found on Meta::CPAN. e.g. the permissions of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/author/HANDOFF/permissions&#x22;&#x3E;HANDOFF&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally, I&#x27;ve also started to create similar listings with a different view on modules that are up for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/adoption&#x22;&#x3E;adoption&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So if you have free time and would be interested to contribute to the Perl community, one way would be to pick up a module and start maintaining it. If you need help with that, let me know and I&#x27;ll try to point you to the channels where you can get &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/help&#x22;&#x3E;help&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;-&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On a more personal note, I just finished watching the mini-series &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Small_Light&#x22;&#x3E;A Small Light&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It made me really sad and at the same time furious with all the self-declared &#x27;humanitarians&#x27; who try to paint Israel as being similar to Nazi Germany. It is especially disgusting, and even frightening, when celebrities do it and tens of thousands of people celebrate them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;-&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anyway, enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#619 - Maintenance of CPAN modules</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/619.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There are way too many CPAN modules that are abandoned or at least not maintained. Even many central ones rarely see activity. It is not very surprising though. Many people who used to develop and maintain these modules have moved to some job where the particular module is not needed or even where they use other languages. Actually I see similar things in Python as well, but let&#x27;s focus on Perl now.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Encountering an issue in such a module that is hardly maintained is a frustrating experience as you could also read in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2023/05/mission-almost-accomplished/&#x22;&#x3E;recent article&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of Dave Cross. However, it is not only frustrating. It hinders the efforts to get the job done. If it is an individual who wants to write some personal code that&#x27;s &#x27;just&#x27; frustrating. If it is a corporation then this actually cost a lot of money in wasted time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So what can be done about this?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For individuals such as Dave and plenty of people on this list, I think really the only solution is to take over the maintenance of the modules.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A corporation has various strategies. They can allocate time to their employees to fix the issues in the open source libraries. They can hire someone to work on these open source libraries. They could try to contract the developers and maintainers of these modules. Or they can just disregard the problem and basically make their own employees (that&#x27;s probably you) frustrated and waste a lot of time overcoming the issues.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;After I read &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://words.filippo.io/full-time-maintainer/&#x22;&#x3E;this article&#x3C;/a&#x3E; a few weeks ago I wanted to see if I could offer a similar serveice. An alternative to the solutions mentioned before. &#x3C;b&#x3E;In a nutshell&#x3C;/b&#x3E;: companies could contract me specifically to work on the open source libraries they care about. (primarily Perl and Python libraries). I contacted a few companies and started to work with some of them on the idea.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;My original thought was that we&#x27;ll agree upon a certain list of modules and I&#x27;ll work on that. Instead of that my first task is a more generic one. To make a tool that can help us evaluate the problems for a particular set of modules and decide what is more urgent. Basically triage the issues across a few 10s or more likely a few 100s of CPAN modules.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So in the last week or so I changed the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; a lot. Besides listing the most recently uploaded modules it now has a list of the most heavily dependent on modules based on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://neilb.org/2015/04/20/river-of-cpan.html&#x22;&#x3E;river analogy&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of Neil Bowers. It has a page for every distribution and every author. There is plenty of more to improve on it, but I am glad there are at least a few people who see this type of work valuable.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not good at marketing and sales so I figured the only way this model could work if some of you working at corporations who understand the need will become the local champions of the idea. Then we could work together to formulate the service to your management in a way that will be valuable to them. If you think this could help you, talk to me so we can figure this out together.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#618 - Conference Season?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/618.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It seems we have been spoiled with the in-person conference. For all the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans, we got two choices, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.to/tprc-2023-tor&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in Toronto&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlkohacon.fi&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Koha Conference in Helsinki&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I would highly recommend the one convenient to you. We all need to come together and share the knowledge.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am all set for the one in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Thanks to the organisers, I got the time slot to give a talk on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Looking at the list of attendees and speakers, it is going to be fun 3 days event. Looking forward to meet fellow &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; members at the event.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Few weeks ago, I spoke about the ambitious project, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl Conference in India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Soon I realised, it isn&#x27;t the right time to talk about. Although not my idea originally, I am taking a back seat for now. I hope to see it happening in my life time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#617 - The business risks of using CPAN</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/617.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;You might know that I talk and write a lot about Open Source and I have a number of open source projects. Mostly web applications. One of them is the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; where I try to analyze CPAN packages and point to directions for relatively easy improvement. The most basic one would be a link to the public VCS (Version Control System) of the project.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We have some historical data points with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html&#x22;&#x3E;weekly reports&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Around 80% of the recently uploaded distributions have a link to their VCS. It is not bad, but is still 20% less than would be ideal. I am less happy about the fact that only 50% use any CI to check their code before it is released to CPAN.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;All this boils down to trying figure out the business risks of using Open Source 3rd party libraries in general and Perl modules in particular along with ways to alleviate them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;When you or your boss think about your Perl-based application, what are the things that make you worry? Do you bump into issues with modules that are not fixed? If you try to fix the issues, do you feel that it is hard to understand the code of the module?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What would make your life as a programmer using Perl easier? What would make your manager happier? Write a blog post. Comment on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/506&#x22;&#x3E;this issue&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or reply to me in private!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
