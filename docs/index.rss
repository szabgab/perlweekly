<title>#551 - Nothing to do with Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/551.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two weeks ago I wrote about Worlde and that it has &#x27;Nothing to do with Perl&#x27;. Within a few hours Saif Ahmed prooved me wrong and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/siuqy9/nothing_to_do_with_perl/&#x22;&#x3E;posted&#x3C;/a&#x3E; an implementation of Wordle in Perl. That&#x27;s the spirit!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On a totally different topic, but still nothing to do with Perl: I just saw someone I know from the Perl community posting yet another disgusting accusation agains Israel. As people more clever than me said: &#x27;In the Middle Ages, Jews were accused of killing Christ. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century they were accused of ruining the nations where they lived. Today they are accused of apartheid, genocide, and having concentration camps&#x27;. Some people always find ways to blame the Jews for the crimes that are considered the worst by the contemporary civilization. Why am I writing about this, you ask? Because it hurts me a lot. You can&#x27;t do much about it, but I hope that whenever you hear or see something horrific thing that Israel is accused of, you will double and tripple-check it before you accept it as truth, &#x27;like&#x27; it, or &#x27;share&#x27; it. I hope you&#x27;ll remember that an awful lot of misinformation is spread by people. Both by people who have an agenda against Jews and people who fall for the truth-looking lies.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#550 - Perl &#x26; Unicode</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/550.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Are you Unicode fan?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Personally, I am not. Reason, I still struggle to get my head around it. During my early days of learning, I never got the opportunity to work with Unicode. So far, I never had to extensively deal with Unicode characters. There is so much information available on internet. I remember, long time ago, I was dealing with well known warning &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Wide character in print&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. After a quick search, I came across this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15210532/use-of-use-utf8-gives-me-wide-character-in-print&#x22;&#x3E;thread&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have kept it bookmark for future reference. I am repeating myself as I remember talking about in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/498.html&#x22;&#x3E;weekly newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; earlier. It is worth sharing with the readers again and again.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;However, there is another reason why I am talking about it today. Let me share gem of an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/drhyde/a-brief-guide-to-perl-character-encoding-if7&#x22;&#x3E;article&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;David Cantrell&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The article gives us inside out knowledge about Unicode, specially for a Perl developer. It has cleared most of my doubts, so a big thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;David&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for such a great article. It also introduced me to a new word, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mojibake&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. A friend of mine on Facebook, suggested a CPAN module, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Mojibake&#x22;&#x3E;Test::Mojibake&#x3C;/a&#x3E; which is very handy. I wish there was dedicated book on Perl and Unicode. Having said, I found this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Perl_Programming/Unicode_UTF-8&#x22;&#x3E;Wikibook&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on the subject, you may want to explore.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I came across &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube video&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that explains the Unicode in general that any layman can easily understand as well. I loved it the way it is explain in a casual way. The guy in the video makes it so simple.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Let&#x27;s talk about regex in Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am sure you have used regex in Perl at some point in your career. Few days ago, I found out a clever piece of regex shared by Abigail. The use of //g in list context. It completely blown me away. Later someone pointed me to the official Perl &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre#Repeated-Patterns-Matching-a-Zero-length-Substring&#x22;&#x3E;documentation&#x3C;/a&#x3E; talking about it. If you are curious to know more about it then I would suggest you please take a look at his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://abigail.github.io/HTML/Perl-Weekly-Challenge/week-150-1.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#549 - Wordle</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/549.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Probably many of you have seen people posting their Wordle results. It is a nice little game that originally was written fo English speakers. Then several open source versions popped up that were then forked to create versions in many languages.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://wordle.szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;partial list of Wordle clones&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I was hoping the author of one of these open source versions would make it easy to add other languages and then people would not need to host their own translated versions. So far I have not seen that happen.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anyway, this has nothing to do with Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#548 - Perl Books Collection</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/548.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you have a Perl books collection?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am sure most of us own the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Camel&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; book. As you know, there have been hardly any new &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; books published in recent years. I recently bought two very popular &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; books &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;Extending and Embedding Perl&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;Network Programming with Perl&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have realised there are two distinct views about good old &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; books. One view is that the recommendations in these books are no longer in use, since we have better choices available on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; now. I fully agree with this view but I also agree to the other view that it is still relevant in terms of base knowledge of the subject. Above all, there is a sentimental values attached to each &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; book that I own.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;How about you?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, spoke about learning languages in his editorial. Being an &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Indian&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by birth, I know more than just the national language of India, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hindi&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I can understand, to be precise, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;six human languages&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Nowadays, I am learning &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Spanish&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; from my daughter as she is learning as part of her school curriculum. But here I would like to know how many programming languages one can fluently code in. Recently in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; contest, we have received loads of solutions in different languages. In &#x3C;strong&#x3E;week 147&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, we received &#x3C;strong&#x3E;100+&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; solutions. One member who stands out front the crowd is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Abigail&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, who has contributed in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;30 different programming languages&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. To me it seems impossible, but he did it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;How many programming languages do I know? Well thanks to the weekly challenge, I have had the opportunity to code in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Python&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Java&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Swift&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as well as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, of course. Do you want to try some new languages? Please give it a try.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the week and stay safe.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#547 - Learning a human language vs. a programming language</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/547.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Learning a programming language is not easy, but have you tried learning a human language? You don&#x27;t have a compiler to tell you when you make a syntax error. You have a lot more words and rules and a lot more exceptions than in a programming language. Mostly however, the lack of quick feedback is what makes it hard. However, after a few months work you start to be able to speak to people in their native language.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As you might have read I&#x27;ve started to learn Ladino - the language spoken by the Jews who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula more than 500 years ago. It is a mix of medieval Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Turkish, Serb, Arabic, and Hebrew. It is a fantastic exercise and it involves programming as well. Join me!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Something else: In Israel every Saturday evening, once the Shabbat ends, and throughout Sunday people say &#x27;have a good week&#x27;. Referring to the week that starts on Sunday, the first day of our work-week. I don&#x27;t recall ever hearing that or anything similar in Hungary. Not even on Sunday or Monday. I wonder, do you use any similar expression in whatever country and language environment you live in? Let me know and...&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a good week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#546 - Perl Books</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/546.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Welcome to my first edition of 2022 and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;95th edition&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; overall.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I remember there was a time when the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;O&#x27;Reilly&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; group published many Perl books. Then came a few other publishing houses like &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Manning&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; publications. I am sure you must have owned a handful of Perl books from these publishers. In recent times not many Perl books have been written, except one or two by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. A friend of mine donated all his Perl books to a local library as he is moving to Python. It is a sad state to be honest. Recently, I came across a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; post by a friend of mine about a Perl book called &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Extending and Embedding Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I knew about it but I had never had the chance to read it. So I decided to buy a used copy from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Amazon&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I must confess I was missing a great deal. If you haven&#x27;t read it then you must check it out. By the way, I have kept all my Perl books safe. I like to read physical books and not online versions.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;With a new year, there is a tradition of new year resolutions. As far as I am concerned, I stopped making any resolutions two years ago. But this year, I decided to make one and stick to it. And the resolution is to get the draft of my first Perl book out as soon as possible. It has been going on for months now. It is embarassing now to even talk about it. There are so many things going on at the same time, I hardly find time for the book. Please wish me luck.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A long time ago, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; started a campaign to make live videos about Perl. He even did few pair-programming sessions and they were very popular. But then there has been no noise on that front in recent times. I used to make &#x3C;strong&#x3E;YouTube&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; videos for the Weekly Challenge during the middle of last year and then I also stopped because of lack of time. Last month, I started making videos again for the Weekly Challenge. It gives me immense pleasure when I see comments on my videos. Someone recently commented on one video and requested I should make videos of past challenges as well. I have to manage my time carefully otherwise my first book would be neglected again. Having said that, I am not giving up on making videos for the Weekly Challenge. If you are interested then please do check out my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube Channel&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is one piece of good news shared by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; - that the MMVP (minimally minimal viable product) RFC for Corinna has been sent to P5P. I am keeping my fingers crossed.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least, please look after yourself and your loved ones.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#545 - Happy, Healthy, and Prosperous New Year!</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/545.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi everyone!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Let me start by welcoming you to the new year! Let me also use the opportunity to thank &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://manwar.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Mohammad S. Anwar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for his dedication in both editing every other edition of the Perl Weekly Newsletter and his very own &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Let me also thank &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://davecross.co.uk/&#x22;&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for his immense help making our grammar a bit more bearable and the various Open Source projects he creates. (e.g. the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpandashboard.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Dashboard&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.theplanetarium.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl Planetarium&#x3C;/a&#x3E;). If you also like their work please thank them in an email, a blog post, or by supporting them via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar/&#x22;&#x3E;Patreon for Mohammad&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/davorg/&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub for Dave&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. They won&#x27;t become wealthy from this, but receiving a paycheck every month from tens of supporters give a huge boost to the ego and makes one create even more for the public.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As for me, you might recall I&#x27;ve been learning Spanish for more than 3 years and started to learn Ladino (aka. Judeo-Spanish) a few weeks ago. Learning a foreign language is a totally different experience than learning a programming language. If for nothing else, because you don&#x27;t get immediate feedback to your mistakes from a compiler. Well. Except if you use an application that helps you. My open source mindset quickly kicked in. I found an Open Source platform called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://librelingo.app/&#x22;&#x3E;LibreLingo&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that will help you learn languages. It is still in very early version, but started to use that platform to be able to practice Ladino and also started to contribute to the project. I&#x27;ll share more about it when enough progress was made to show something in public. Until then you are invited to check it out.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the year ahead!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/544.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We wish all the readers of the newsletter, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Merry Christmas&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I hope and wish you are all enjoying quality time with your loved ones.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Belated happy birthday to my favourite language, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, on completing 34 years. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mark Gardner&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; used his weekly blogging schedule to celebrate the occassion in his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/12/21/34-at-34-for-v5-34-modern-perl-features-for-perls-birthday&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you remember which year you first picked up the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; language?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For me, I was introduced to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the year 1998. So technically, I am 23 Perl years old. How about you? I am wondering if anyone other than the creator picked the language in the first year that it existed. If you know their name then please do share it with us. I am sure there must be a handful of people that I am not aware of.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Talking about birthday celebrations, I would like to wish belated Happy Birthday to the mother of our chief editor, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. As per the record, my birthday was last Monday i.e. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;20th December&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. To date, I have never celebrated my birthday, this year also went without celebration.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I noticed that I am getting close to my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;100th edition&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of the newsletter. This is my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;94th edition&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It would be a big achievement for me, personally, to reach that number. I am looking forward to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;556th edition&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of the weekly newsletter as that will be my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;100th edition&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Stay safe and enjoy the holiday break.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Thomas Klausner sent me a bunch of links and suggestion, let me share them first:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abigail has a series of Advent posts starting from &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://abigail.github.io/HTML/AdventOfCode/2021/day-01.html&#x22;&#x3E;day 01&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I did not find a page listing all the entries but you can get to them by changing the URL. Smylers is doing crazy stuff with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/smylers2/status/1334150980552757250&#x22;&#x3E;vim (and perl)&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. One can find a lot of inspiring code (Perl, Raku and of course other languages) in the various &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode&#x22;&#x3E;&#x27;Solution Megathreads&#x27;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on Reddit.  Finally domm himself has a few &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://domm.plix.at/tags/AdventOfCode.html&#x22;&#x3E;Advent related posts&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today we are celebrating the 80th birthday of my mother. Due to the pandemic we cannot celebrate in the same space, but we have collected some videos from the family members and her friends and we are going to have a Zoom session. Much better than not being able to celebrate at all. Happy birthday mom!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In a few days a large part of the world is going to celebrate the birthday of another Jew.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Merry Christmas!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#542 - Perl Advent Calendar</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/542.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;How you all doing? Are you making the most of the festive season?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/540.html&#x22;&#x3E;540th edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the weekly newsletter, I mentioned &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendars&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I noticed some activity in the GitHub repository for the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and was hoping to see another exciting edition full of Perl projects. A friend of mine on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; mentioned that this year the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://perladvent.org/2021/index.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is looking a bit sparse. At the time of writing this editorial, I have only seen &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://perladvent.org/2021/2021-12-01.html&#x22;&#x3E;one post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; i.e. Day 1 of Year 2021. Being one of many contributors in the past, I am sad to see the current state of the project. I have absolutely no idea what happened this year. I know I have too many things already on my plate but I would like to help to get the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; back to its original glory.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendars&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I would like to mention &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2021&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; which has mix of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; like in the past. We have been running this since the beginning i.e. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. You will find some of the fun tasks from the past year being discussed by members of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have made a slight change to the look and feel this year. I hope you like it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;How about the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://24pullrequests.com&#x22;&#x3E;24 Pull Requests&#x3C;/a&#x3E; event?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have not seen it being discussed either on any of the social platforms e.g. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Twitter&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; or &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LinkedIn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I haven&#x27;t had chance to take part this year. I couldn&#x27;t take part last year either; what a shame. I still have 10 days and I have booked a few days off work. So there is a possibility I might take part and even complete the challenge. Please wish me luck.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, leader of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; project, announced that he had a great meeting with the Perl Steering Council and they are extremely receptive to Corinna going into the core. I can&#x27;t wait for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to be part of core Perl. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Damian&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; shared the details on one of issues discussed in the same meeting in a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2021/12/a-not-so-simple-matter-of-privacy.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. You definitely don&#x27;t want to miss it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
