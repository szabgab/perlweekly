<title>#671 - In-person and online events</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/671.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week I included an entry about the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301268306/&#x22;&#x3E;Getting started with Docker for Perl developers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; workshop I am going to run on June 13. This is part of a series of free virtual workshops I started to offer via the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/&#x22;&#x3E;Code Mavens&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Meetup group. If things go well I&#x27;ll run workshops for 3 languages: Perl, Python, and Rust and several related technologies. I&#x27;ve already schedule 3 events for Rust, 2 for Python, and 1 for Perl. Now, to plan ahead, I scheduled another Perl event:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301413566/&#x22;&#x3E;Continuous Integration (CI): GitHub Actions for Perl Projects&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on July 14.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Even it these events are not relevant to you or they are not scheduled at a time when you can be available I&#x27;d like to invite you to register to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/&#x22;&#x3E;Code Mavens&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Meetup-group to get notified about other events. I am also going to send out (again) a survey to understand better what topics are more interesting to the members of that group, and at what time would it be most convenient for them. So by registering and voting for Perl you could get more Perl-related events.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last Week Mohammad mentioned both the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku conference&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to take place in Las Vegas between June 24-28 and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/&#x22;&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Workshop&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that will take place, surprisingly, in London on October 26. Are there other in-person or virtual Perl conferences, workshops, or meeting planned? Let us know so we can include them in the Perl Weekly! At the bottom of each edition and on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;events&#x3C;/a&#x3E; page.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The last thing I would like to highlight this week is a link Wendy shared a few days ago of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.flickr.com/groups/yapc/pool/&#x22;&#x3E;lots of pictures from YAPCs since 2003&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I even found several pictures of myself and became a bit nostalgic.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#670 - Conference Season ...</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/670.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Are you regulars to Perl conference?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If yes then you have two upcoming conferences &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in Las Vegas&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024&#x22;&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Workshop&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Depending on your availability and convenience, I would highly recommend you register your interest to your choice(s) of conference. And if you are attending then do take the plunge give your first talk if you have not done so before. It doesn&#x27;t have to be long talk, you can try quick 5 minutes lightning talk to begin with.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How about become a sponsor to the conference?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Believe it or not, it is vital that we provide financial support in the form of sponsor. So if you know someone who is in a position to support these events then please do share this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/this-is-your-opportunity-to-sponsor-the-perl-and-raku-conference-2024&#x22;&#x3E;TPRC 2024 Sponsors&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/announcing-the-london-perl-raku-workshop-2024-lpw&#x22;&#x3E;LPW 2024 Sponsors&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with them. It would be a big help to organise such events.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Keynote speakers for TPRC 2024...&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I came across this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://ovid.github.io/blog/being-a-keynote-speaker.html&#x22;&#x3E;post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; where it is announced that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is going to be keynote speaker at the event. Well there is a bonus for all attending the event, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Damian Conway&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; would be giving a keynote remotely. I am sure, it is going to be a memorable moment to celebrate the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;25th anniversary&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Similarly, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; would be celebrating &#x3C;strong&#x3E;20th anniversary&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; this year. I wanted to attend the TPRC 2024 in Las Vegas but for personal reason I am unable to attend. What a shame but at least I am definitely going to be part of LPW 2024 as it is local to me. No need to book travel ticket or reserve hotel room.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How many of you know about Pull Request Club?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://pullrequest.club/hello&#x22;&#x3E;Pull Request Club&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is run by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Kivanc Yazan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It started in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Jan 2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I had the pleasure to be associated with it since the beginning. I never missed the assignment until the last I contributed in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;January 2022&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Unfortunately I faced too much distraction and missed the fun ever since. I found this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://kyzn.org/pull-request-club-2021-2023-report&#x22;&#x3E;annual report&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by the creator himself. If you like contributing to opensource projects then you should join the club and have fun.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For all cricket fans in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, did you watch the final of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;IPL 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;? I did and happy to see my favourite team, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Kolkatta Knight Riders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; lifting the trophy. Although, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;SRH&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the loosing team was my favourite too but it didn&#x27;t play to their capability. I am now looking forward to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;T20 World Cup&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; next. How about you?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Bank Holiday&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in England, so relax day for me. Enjoy rest of the newsletter. Last but not least, please do look after yourself and your loved ones.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#669 - How Time Machine works</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/669.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week Mohammed wrote that he can&#x27;t wait to test out perl 5.40. In response Michiel Beijen wrote a blog post explaining how you can already try 5.39.10, using plenv. I love this!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As you might know a while ago I stopped using mailman for the Perl Weekly and now both the subscription and unsubscription process is done by sending me an email that I read and process manually. This gives an excellent opportunity to the new subscribers to introduce themselves and even to mention the subjects that are interested in.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As the Perl Weekly is a news aggregator I am going to share some of the items in his mail hoping that some of you will write blog posts covering some of the issues.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;After a long break from Perl, I&#x27;m looking for best current practice on building a website for a cycling club.  So I&#x27;m curious about the full stack (for collaborative dev, integration, and public deployment) the architecture (MVC (Dancer2 or Mojolicious) &#x26; DB), and frameworks for Plack/PSGI, JavaScript, unit and acceptance testing, and OO, for example.&#x3C;br&#x3E;Also, what collaborative tools to use for Scrum/Kanban collaboration, and source control, CI and CD.&#x3C;br&#x3E; To start with, I am hunting around for best practice on a dev Webserver and client, and, later, a public web hosting server.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This was my response: To respond to your questions: I personally was using Dancer a lot, but  Mojolicious seems to have slightly more development activity.&#x3C;br&#x3E;For CI I use either GitHub Actions or GitLab pipelines depending on which git hosting service the project uses.&#x3C;br&#x3E;I rent a server at &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linode.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Linode&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but I have converted many of my sites to be static using some Static Site Generator and then I host them on GitHub pages.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I hope you&#x27;ll have more detailed answer.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Actually, in this edition we have a post by Dave Cross on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2024/05/deploying-dancer-apps/&#x22;&#x3E;Deploying Dancer Apps&#x3C;/a&#x3E; already responding to part of the questions. This is how time-machine works.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a nice week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/668.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The latest Perl Steering Council weekly updates about the good progress in preparation of release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.40&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I can&#x27;t wait to get my hand dirty with the new features.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;London Perl Workshop is making good progress thanks to the hard work of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. As per the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024&#x22;&#x3E;official website&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, we now have a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Diamond Sponsor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am hoping venue would be finalised soon. I would urge all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans to register your interest in the event so that the organiser can plan the event better.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The upconing event, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in Las Vegas&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, is in demand. I get to hear a lot of preparation is underway to make it memorable experience for all attendees. I am going to miss the fun, unfortunately. I hope to join you all online if it is available.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least, you take extra care of yourself and your loved ones. Enjoy and celebrate Perl as always.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#667 - Call for papers and sponsors for LPW 2024</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/667.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week Mohammed already mentioned the LPW, now they have a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2024/05/lpw-2024---call-for-papers-and-sponsors.html&#x22;&#x3E;Call For Papers and Sponsors&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am glad they write on bpo, but I also wonder, do they publish the CFP on other web sites as well. e.g. DEV.to?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I don&#x27;t have a lot of time dealing with Perl these days, but I looked at the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/recent&#x22;&#x3E;recent report of CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and I see there are still quite a few CPAN packages that do not link to their public Version Control System (VCS). If you have some spare time maybe you could check out the modules in the &#x3C;b&#x3E;VCS&#x3C;/b&#x3E; column and ask the author to add the appropriate fields so it will be easier for others to find the git repository.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is the Holocaust memorial day in Israel. I assume most of the readers of the Perl Weekly know what it is about, but I am surprised how many people in the world have never heard the word or don&#x27;t know what it is about. I spend the day partially by watching interviews and lectures. I listed some of them on my site: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/holocaust-memorial-day-in-israel-2024&#x22;&#x3E;Holocaust memorial day in Israel in 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I also wrote an article titled &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/humanitarian-aid-for-gaza&#x22;&#x3E;Rafah and the humanitarian aid for Gaza&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you&#x27;d like to read more about the topic from me, you can &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/subscribe&#x22;&#x3E;register to my newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Unfortunately I need to deal with this quite a lot instead of sending Pull-Requests.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;You, enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#666 - LPW 2024</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/666.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As we all know, German Perl/Raku Workshop 2024 happend few weeks ago, it turned out to be lucky for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. After GPW, we got the official announcement of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2024/04/announcing-the-london-perl-and-raku-workshop-2024-lpw.html&#x22;&#x3E;LPW 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is going to be one day event as per the tradition. The tentative date as of today is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;26th October 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and it is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Saturday&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are &#x3C;strong&#x3E;FREE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then don&#x27;t forget to plan your visit in advance. It is returning after a gap of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;5 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It would be a special event for one more reason as it would be the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;20th anniversay&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in terms of years. I am very happy to see the support we already got. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; shared the news that he has submitted &#x3C;strong&#x3E;4 talks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; already. If you are planning to attend then please submit your talk as well. &#x3C;stron&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; always encourage first time speakers. If you can&#x27;t make it full length talk then you can even submit &#x3C;strong&#x3E;5 minutes&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; lightning talk. To my surprise, as soon as the annoucement was public, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://geekuni.com/corporate-perl-training&#x22;&#x3E;Geekuni&#x3C;/a&#x3E; became the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Silver Sponsor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Ofcourse, we are looking for more sponsors. If your workplace codebase uses &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then I would suggest you please speak to the management if they are willing to sponsor the event. You can find more details about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/sponsoring.html&#x22;&#x3E;different sponsor packages&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is another big event happening in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Las Vegas&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and it is &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference&#x3C;/a&#x3E; from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;24-28 June 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The event organisers made a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/tprc2024vol&#x22;&#x3E;Call for Volunteers&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I had plan to attend the event with family as it is happening in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Las Vegas&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Now the circumstance is such that even my own visit is not confirmed. It would be a big loss if I don&#x27;t make it to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Las Vegas&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; this time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you remember the last major release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;? It was special because of the inclusion of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am hoping, in the next release &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.40&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, we get more features added to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. According to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/5fdf6e90221900a85cd3091bd2755e41fc230d4d/Porting/release_schedule.pod?plain=1#L54&#x22;&#x3E;this document&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, the tentative release date is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;20th May 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The post series &#x3C;strong&#x3E;What&#x27;s new on CPAN ...&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com&#x22;&#x3E;perl.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is my all time favourite. Recently it got fresh air and we had 4 in a row e.g. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/what-s-new-on-cpan-november-2023&#x22;&#x3E;Nov 23&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/what-s-new-on-cpan-december-2023&#x22;&#x3E;Dec 23&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/what-s-new-on-cpan-january-2024&#x22;&#x3E;Jan 24&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/what-s-new-on-cpan-february-2024&#x22;&#x3E;Feb 24&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is nearly end of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Apr 24&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and we have not seen the post for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mar 24&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I just hope and wish, the tradition doesn&#x27;t die. I am keeping my fingers crossed.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least, you please take a good care of yourself and your loved ones. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;I&#x27;ve used Perl for a while but I would love to be fluent in it.  Please let me know if you have any advice.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I think the best way is to work on projects and if you can find nice people who have time to comment on your work then ask them. Depending on your level you might want to try &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://exercism.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Exercism&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that has a Perl track for practice and a built-in system for asking for and getting feedback on the specific exercises. Even better, once you did the exercises you can become a mentor there helping others. That gives you another opportunity to look at these problems and help other people like yourself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;You can participate in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; run by Mohammad S. Anwar, the other editor of the Perl Weekly.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Longer term I&#x27;d suggest to work on a real project.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Either create a project for yourself or you can start contributing to open source projects (e.g. CPAN modules). I&#x27;d start trying to contribute to active projects - so ones that saw a release recently.  MetaCPAN has a page showing &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/recent&#x22;&#x3E;recent CPAN releases&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the CPAN Digger provides some analytics and suggestions for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/recent&#x22;&#x3E;recent CPAN releases&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. You can also contributed to MetaCPAN itself. This is also a nice way to contribute back to the Perl community.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally, Happy Passover celebrating the freedom of Jews from slavery. Let me wish to you the same we have been saying for hundreds of years at the end of the Passover dinner:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Next year in Jerusalem!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#664 - German Perl Workshop</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/664.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Day 1&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2024/index.html&#x22;&#x3E;German Perl Workshop 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is going to be very busy week for those attending the annual event. As per the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2024/schedule?day=2024-04-15&#x22;&#x3E;schedule&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is giving talk on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2024/talk/7866&#x22;&#x3E;AI&#x2014;This Talk is Always Out of Date&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am pretty sure, it is going to be very popular among the attendees. Most of the talks are going to be in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as expected. English speaking attendees shouldn&#x27;t worry as there would be some talks in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;English&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; too. The team behind the GPW is so friendly and welcoming that you would never get bored throughout the day. It feels great to see how they have managed to organise the event every year. There was a time when &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; used to be so popular that attracted attendees from as far as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Japan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; just for one day event. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; has been pushing hard to make it happen this year. Please show your interest in good numbers if you are LPW fans. Finding Sponsor is the biggest hurdle, if I am not mistaken. I just hope we don&#x27;t miss the opportunity this year.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Recently I got the shocking news about my friend, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Hodgkinson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There was a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; post sharing the news that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; passed away last &#x3C;strong&#x3E;December&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have had the honour to meet him at every LPW event. He would never miss the opportunity to catch up his friends. He was also regular to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Mongers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; meetup. In the last few years when the event didn&#x27;t happen, he was actively engaging with friends on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I used to chat with him on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook messenger&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; regularly. I still have his message wishing me good luck when I joined &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Oleeo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. This news really shocked me. Last &#x3C;strong&#x3E;December&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was so depressing time for me, as I lost my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mom&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; on Boxing day. This is a small tribute to my buddy, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. May his soul rest in peace.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Please take extra care of your health and your loved ones.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It seems I have less and less to write about in these editorials. This is of course not very surprising as I there are fewer and fewer articles published about Perl. The only thing that still keeps this afloat is &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;the Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of Mohammad. So maybe you can &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar/posts&#x22;&#x3E;sponsor it&#x3C;/a&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sad news: Just a few days ago I heard that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/rozallin/posts/pfbid0Smz8cifiBSm6GuPG5Dui1mssNv1TydpncD7sQX5bAGGmb83B9y4B4KWzVYQyghuyl&#x22;&#x3E;Dave Hodgkinson has passed away&#x3C;/a&#x3E; last December. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-hodgkinson/&#x22;&#x3E;LinkedIn&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/davehodg&#x22;&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.davehodgkinson.com/&#x22;&#x3E;web site&#x3C;/a&#x3E; where he posted in November. May he rest in peace and his family find solace. He will be missed.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In a totally unrelated sadness: It has been &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/six-months&#x22;&#x3E;six months.&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I wish you a nicer week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#662 - TPRC in Las Vegas</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/662.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;How time flies, it is incredible. It feels like we just attended &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRC in Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Well the next edition is coming soon, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;June 24-28, 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, to be very precise. At the end of the conference in &#x3C;stron&#x3E;Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; last year, I was determined to attend the next one in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Las Vegas&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. As we all know, you can&#x27;t plan everything and execute it too as per your wish. Honestly speaking, it is the only annual event where you get to meet and greet all the big guns. I would recommend everyone who can afford to attend, must &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc2024.sched.com/tickets&#x22;&#x3E;book the ticket&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and enjoy the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Early Bird&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; offer.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/661.html&#x22;&#x3E;last edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the weekly newsletter, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was discussed in details. There was even call for sponsors for the event as well. I know how hard it is to find a sponsor these days. I remember there was a time when you see sponsor desks all over at the entrance of event. Before, the name of event was enough to bring in sponsors but time has changed and you need to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/5-reasons-to-sponsor-the-perl-toolchain-summit&#x22;&#x3E;share reasons&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to find the sponsor. Thank you, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, for the dedidated blog post to gather the support and sponsors for the event. This year, it is happening in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lisbon, Portugal&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Not far from where I am based but it is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;invite-only&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; event. Having said, anyone interested to be part of the group, can start contributing to the Perl toolchain.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Talking about sponsors, I made an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/644.html&#x22;&#x3E;appeal for sponsor&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, Nov&#x27;23, for my pet project, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge - Perl &#x26; Raku&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I did receive couple of offers but nothing materialised unfortunately. The exercise taught me a lesson, though. In order to find a corporate sponsor, one need to be a registered entity. Since I ran the project single handedly for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;5 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; now with zero experience of running and managing a registered entity, I find it involves lot of paper works and an accountant to look after finance matters. As you have guessed it correctly, this needs funding too. So I am going around the circle and not getting anywhere. I then decided to submit the project for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Outreachy 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; sponsored by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. In the past, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Open Food Facts&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, is the choosen one and is likely to be the case this time too. Time to start fresh again ...&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is the last day of long &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Easter Holiday&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in England. I had planned so much to do in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;4 days&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; break but could only managed to do few. I am happy the school is still on long break at least. I can enjoy &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Monday&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for a change. How was your weekend?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter and look after yourself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
