<title>#713 - Why do companies migrate away from Perl?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/713.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Ramadan seems to have a very positive impact on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://manwar.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Mohammad Sajid Anwar (manwar)&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, author of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and co-editor of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl Weekly newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. He learns all kinds of new things and writes long blog posts about them. Some of them are Perl related, some are not. Anyway, see the links in this newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I, on the other hand, was recently contacted by a number of people wanting to migrate from Perl to Rust or Python. My first question is &#x3C;b&#x3E;why&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. After all even if I end up helping them with the move, I need to understand why do they want to move. Because of this I started to have some picture of why people feel the urge to move away from Perl. However, my sample is too small and probably rather biased.  None of the people who contacted me wanted to move to Java or C, or NodeJS. That&#x27;s can be for many reasons, one of them the fact that I don&#x27;t mention those languages on my LinkedIn profile.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So I&#x27;d like to get your help in understanding the central motivations for wanting to move away from Perl. If your company has moved away or is discussing the idea, I&#x27;d love to hear from you (a private email would be excellent) to understand the real pain points.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the other hand, if your company has recently moved to Perl or is planning to do so, I&#x27;d love to hear about that too. If they need help I&#x27;d be glad to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://szabgab.com/moving-between-perl-python-rust&#x22;&#x3E;help them too&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and I am sure people in the Perl community would be thrilled to hear such stories. Even if we can&#x27;t publish the names of the companies.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#712 - RIP Zefram</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/712.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We lost, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Zefram&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, a very respectable and prolific contributor to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; core. The sad news was shared on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2025/03/msg269672.html&#x22;&#x3E;P5P&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. He was a regular attendee of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Although I never interacted with him personally,  I always followed his contributions on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/author/ZEFRAM&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I also found his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.fysh.org/~zefram&#x22;&#x3E;web space&#x3C;/a&#x3E; where his works are nicely logged. Additionally, there is a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZZBYRT5Ghc&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube video&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of him presenting at the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop 2015&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is happening from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;May 1 to May 4, 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Hosting such event is only possible because of the generous sponsors, as &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perltoolchainsummit.org/pts2025/sponsors.html&#x22;&#x3E;listed here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Speaking of sponsors, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Deriv&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, is one name you&#x27;ll find at most &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; gatherings. There is a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/why-deriv-supports-the-perl-ecosystem&#x22;&#x3E;dedicated post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that details why? I remember when &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Booking.com&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; used to be everywhere and was often the first to sponsor. Finding a sponsor in current environment is really tough, all credit goes to the team working tirelessly behind the scenes.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have a firsthand experience in seeking sponsors for my pet project: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I was lucky enough to find our first sponsor, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Careers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; (by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Pete Sergeant&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;) without much effort. After a long term sponsorship, he stopped it about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; ago. Fortunately, we immediately found another generous sponsor, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance Wicks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, who has been our solo sponsor ever since. In both cases, I didn&#x27;t actively seek out sponsors, they found us. The main obstacle we face is that we are not a registered organisation. It remains a one-man organisation, and I lack the experience to run a registered organisation entity.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ramadan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; continues, today marks &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Day 17 of Ramadan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and I find my routine slightly disrupted. Not that I am complaining, it is just that my sleep pattern has changed. I don&#x27;t need to emphasize, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;How important is sleep.&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; I have learned that the hard way. However, there is a positive side to this change in routine. It has given me time to re-visit my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TODO&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; list. There was a time when I used to blog regularly but then I stopped completely. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve noticed but I&#x27;ve started writing again. Below are some of my recent posts, in case you missed any.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is still a lot in the pipeline. I hope to share it soon. So far, I have received positive feedbacks which has given me the energy to continue. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for your kind words.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I should pause here and give you time to go through rest of the newsletter. Enjoy and please take a good care of your physical and mental health.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#711 - Obfuscating Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/711.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As you might know I used to teach Perl and helped companies using Perl. Unfortunately, in the last couple of years only a few companies asked for my help with Perl and in most cases in areas I am not that familiar with. So I referred them to other, well known consultants.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Instead of Perl most of my clients are asking for help with Python and Rust. Especially because of the latter I felt the need to know more about C and C++. At least to the level where I understand the questions C/C++ programmers might have about Rust. So I dusted off my copy of &#x22;The C programming language&#x22; and started to learn again.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This time it will be especially fun as my son - who has been a professional programmer for more than 6 years now - decided to get a degree in Computer Sciences so he is also taking classes about C.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The way I learn is by trying to implement things and trying to explain them. So I am going to post about my new journey with C on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://c.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;C Maven&#x3C;/a&#x3E; web site. You have been warned.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In other news we are celebrating Purim this week, when everyone dresses up as someone else. I wonder if I should dress up as a C programmer?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#710 - PPC - Perl Proposed Changes</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/710.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you remember, the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/706.html&#x22;&#x3E;weekly newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; where I mentioned about the work carried out for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PPC web portal&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, it is now fully functional and operative: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.github.io/PPCs&#x22;&#x3E;PPC&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It has everything that you need to know about the future plan of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Not only that, you can also involve in the new feature request. It made the process smooth and easy to understand. You can also take part in the discussion as well. This is your opportunity to share your view on the work being carried out. Or if you have any suggestion, you can use the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.github.io/PPCs/template&#x22;&#x3E;template&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to submit your ideas. Isn&#x27;t it simple? The best part for me is the ability to join the discussion in the work being done before it becomes the part of future release.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/709.html&#x22;&#x3E;last edition of newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, there was an announcement about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German Perl/Raku Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I encourage every community members to come forward and help the organisers to make it reach wider audiences. There is another announcement about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/from-code-to-community-sponsoring-tprc-2025&#x22;&#x3E;The North American Perl and Raku Conference&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Please do share the details with your colleagues and friends.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Are you new to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and want to learn in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then checkout this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/zaphoddont/learning-perl-in-2025-3od3&#x22;&#x3E;post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Here is another: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://medium.com/@chandantechie/step-by-step-guide-to-learning-perl-programming-from-novice-to-expert-56eaa0fce54b&#x22;&#x3E;Step-by-Step Guide to Learning PERL Programming: From Novice to Expert&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Day 3 of Ramadan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in England. May &#x3C;strong&#x3E;ALLAH s.w.t&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; bless you with peace, happiness and prosperity.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#709 - GPRW and Perl Toolchain Summit</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/709.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;A reminder: The 27th &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl-workshop.de/&#x22;&#x3E;German Perl/Raku Workshop&#x3C;/a&#x3E; will take place between May 12-14, 2025, in Munich, Germany with &#x22;ticketing systems&#x22; as the main theme. The focus will be on building ticketing software, addressing real-world challenges, and exploring practical solutions. In addition to this deep dive, attendees can look forward to a variety of cutting-edge and exciting topics presented by renowned speakers. Whether you&#x27;re a seasoned developer or just curious about the latest in Perl and Raku, this event promises insights and inspiration for everyone!. See official &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/i&#x22;&#x3E;website for more info&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Philippe Bruhat sent me a message: The Perl Toolchain Summit is happening again in 2025. This year, we&#x27;re going to be in Leipzig, hosted by Daniel B&#xF6;hmer and Tina M&#xFC;ller, from May 1st to May 4th, 2025. This year again, we&#x27;re going to need the support of sponsors to be able to bring our 30+ attendees in the same place at the same time to work on the Perl and CPAN toolchain. Download our &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perltoolchainsummit.org/pts2025/PTS2025-Sponsor-Prospectus.pdf&#x22;&#x3E;sponsor prospectus&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.

&#x3C;p&#x3E;After several weeks in Hungary I am now back to Israel. We are having in-person events in the other language communities. Unfortunately not Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;However, I still offer help to companies that would like to reduce their bugs in their programming environment in Perl, Python, or Rust or that would like help introducing either of those languages.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a nice week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#708 - Perl is growing...</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/708.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There&#x2002;are many interpretations of what it means to grow? I am using the term for&#x2002;new features. We get lots of&#x2002;improvements and new features with every release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. In &#x3C;strong&#x3E;v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the&#x2002;experimental &#x3C;strong&#x3E;class feature&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was rolled out in core. In the next maintenance release of Perl&#x2002;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;v5.40&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, new field attribute &#x3C;strong&#x3E;:reader&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was added and&#x2002;many other improvements. The next thing, we all waited was for field attribute &#x3C;strong&#x3E;:writer&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Luckily it is already part of development release &#x3C;strong&#x3E;v5.41.7&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I made this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://gist.github.com/manwar/b7579bf6ba2b8aa05434972d2beb03a3&#x22;&#x3E;gist&#x3C;/a&#x3E; demonstrating the core&#x2002;changes.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you are new to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x2002;Release Policy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then there are two types of release i.e. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Maintenance&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Development&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The even numbers&#x2002;are reserved for the maintenance release e.g. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;v5.38, v5.40&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; whereas odd numbers are for the development release e.g. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;v5.39, v5.41&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The maintenance release are mostly production ready.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you are interested in release history then please checkout the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_5_version_history&#x22;&#x3E;version history&#x3C;/a&#x3E; page. I found an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/PPCs/pull/58&#x22;&#x3E;interesting proposal&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with regard to the version number.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#707 - Is it ethical?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/707.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A week or so ago I &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/szabgab_perl-python-rust-activity-7289991817306034177-Xra2&#x22;&#x3E;posted on LinkedIn&#x3C;/a&#x3E; asking the rather rhetorical question, if I should offer a service helping companies move from Perl to Python or Rust. The comment I got is that I should not as it hurts the Perl community and that it would be &#x3C;b&#x3E;unethical&#x3C;/b&#x3E; to rewrite something in an inferior language. I admit, this comment really annoyed me.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Instead of arguing I published &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/szabgab_perl-python-perl-activity-7290365095337979905-Mbnh&#x22;&#x3E;another post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; asking if it would be ethical to wtite anything in Perl which is, I guess the flip side of the above comment. Now that post got a lot of comments. Some really valuable, some really strange ones.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It think the question of ethics depends a lot on the parties involved. Do I write the program for myself? Am I offering the resulting application as a service? Am I writing it for a client who will have to maintain it? Are the other involved parties informed about the costs and risk of the choices we make?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#706 - Perl in 2025</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/706.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last weekend was busy with the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;FOSDEM 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Did you get the chance to attend the grand event? As always, this time too, we had &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; booth at the event. There was even an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/osdem25&#x22;&#x3E;official statement&#x3C;/a&#x3E; from the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; urging all members to join the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; communities. The venue is not too far from where I live (London), yet I have never attended. In fact, I have never been to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;FOSDEM&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; though every year I plan to attend and end up missing it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;While looking for more information, I came across this gem: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/perl_in_2025&#x22;&#x3E;Perl in 2025&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. This was part of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;FOSDEM 2021&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by the master himself, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you take a closer look, you will realise we are &#x3C;strong&#x3E;almost&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; there. Being human, we are never satisfied and always want more. It is easy to demand more but very hard to give time and energy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you remember, I mentioned about the GitHub repository for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PPC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/696.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Weekly newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Now I hear, this will be exposed as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub pages&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as shared in this two parts post: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2025/01/proposed-perl-changes&#x22;&#x3E;part 1&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2025/02/proposed-perl-changes-part-2&#x22;&#x3E;part 2&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter and please do take extra care of yourself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#705 - Something is moving</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/705.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It seems something is moving in the Perl world. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/new-community-engagement-chair&#x22;&#x3E;D Ruth Holloway became the Community Engagement Chair&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, Dave Cross started to build a web site for the Proposed Perl Changes, and there are going to be changes.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the other hand one of the long-time Perl enthusiasts sent me an angry unsubscribe email telling me how some people (this time it was not me) are ruining Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Fun times!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;At the bottom of the newsletter and also on our &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;Perl events page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; you can find out about all the Perl-related events we know about. If yours isn&#x27;t listed there, it is just a Pull-Request to add it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#704 - Perl Podcast</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/704.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you know of any active Perl Podcast?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It reminds me when &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance Wicks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; reached out to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Joshua McAdams&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to revive &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.perlcast.com&#x22;&#x3E;Perlcast&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I later joined hands with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and we even recorded the first podcast with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out. Fast forward, in the new year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, we have another very active member, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Philippe Bruhat&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, who came up with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://underbar.cpan.io&#x22;&#x3E;The Underbar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Podcast for Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There is already &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Episode 0 - A New Logo for Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is published which was recorded on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;January 10th, 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. You should listen to it and share your feedbacks to the creator. Also please do spread the word about it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German Perl/Raku Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is happening in the beautiful city &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Munich&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Even if &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is not your first language, you can still benefit from the presentations. I attended the workshop in the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, my first time. I enjoyed the 3-days event thoroughly. I even gave couple of presentations in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;English&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. For me, it was the golden opportunity to meet so many &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; stalwarts. I made many friends for life. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/register&#x22;&#x3E;Buy your tickets now&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, it is starting on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;12th May 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and ends on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;14th May 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is another good news in the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; has secured sponsor for another 12 months, thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance Wicks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for the second year back to back.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Stay safe and enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
