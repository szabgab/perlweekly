   xkcd is one of the greatest geek comic. Ever. It now has a module on CPAN. Actually, as Sawyer writes 'I searched CPAN and saw only a few xkcd modules'. Let me emphasize that: He saw only a *few*, and then went on writing another one... I think that attitude has been analyzed already by xkcd. And for all the people who might misunderstand me: I applaud Sawyer and the creation of WWW::xkcd.

   Sawyer X picked up the other end of the discussion. He is explaining what an individual developer could do to enhance her chances to find a good Perlish job. His advice is very good, but I don't find anything there that will specifically help with most of the recruiters. I think that's probably the the whole issue that we, in the Perl community have a way of thinking and certain channels to show (and/or improve) our capabilities while the recruiters - most of them - are looking at other places and talk in a different language. In any case, this discussion is quite healthy.

   Sawyer's thoughts on the state of the Perl 5 community, after taking over from Matt. He ruminates on the definition of community and what sub-communities make up "the Perl 5 community". He ends with his proposed definition for what "community" is really about, and asks us all to think about how to grow our community. One line really resonated with me: "I know that perl fits in my head, and that's why I use it". Duration: 44 minutes.
