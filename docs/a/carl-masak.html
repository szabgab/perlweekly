   <a href="http://ahmadzawawi.blogspot.com/2011/08/learning-perl-6-again-with-carl-masak.html">Learning Perl 6 again with Carl Masak</a><br>
   Earlier Ahmad M. Zawawi contributed a lot to the development of Perl 6 but in the past year he was busy with other things. Now he rediscovers Perl 6 with the help of core Rakudo developer and overall nice guy Carl Masak.

   This is the third part of the series Carl Mäsak has written showing us how the -n and -p parameters work in Rakudo Perl 6. The others are on his blog as well.

   <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/macros-what-are-they-really">Macros in Perl 6 - what are they, really?</a><br>
   Carl Mäsak describes the two kinds of macros the world knows for programming languages: C pre-processor macros and LISP macros that make the language super powerful. Then he goes on and shows how AST macros work in Perl 6.

   <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/the-2011-perl-6-coding-contest">The 2011 Perl 6 Coding Contest</a><br>
   The thing is that this contest can be interesting to anyone who like programming and likes challenges. If you are a 'Perl 5 fan' or a Pythonista, forget about it for a minute. What if this was a Haskell contest? Yeah, I know, you would want to do it as that's one of the coolest language. Writing in Perl 6 is even more interesting. See the announcement of Carl Mäsak

   Even if you don't write Perl 6 code and even if you don't like coding contests, Carl Masak makes this really enjoyable. He explains the problem, and the related issues in a very interesting and easy to read way. Maybe that's only my past as a would-be (and failed) mathematician but I like it.

   I am not sure if I was in Thailand on a beach, I'd search for hexagonal games on my Android phone - especially as I don't have an Android phone - but Carl Mäsak did just that, which resulted in the 4th task in his Perl 6 challenge. If you like puzzles, this is the right place for you.

   Carl Masak has started another writing spree, blogging every day during July as he is developing his adventure game in Perl 6. Not only has he announced it yesterday, he also posted the first entry.

   As mentioned last week, Carl Masak is running a month of blogging. He is writing every day building an Adventure Game in Perl 6. Instead of linking to the 7 posts he made since the beginning, let me link to the intro page, from where he links to the individual articles.
