   This is another article I wrote, this time on my own blog, describing my experience with this list. It might be interesting to you if you'd like to look a bit at the details. I am also comparing the experience with that of Peter Cooper who runs the Ruby Weekly which was the inspiration to this newsletter.

   I wrote this article in response to a question I got. I tried to make the comparison related to the job opportunities.
