   This is another article I wrote, this time on my own blog, describing my experience with this list. It might be interesting to you if you'd like to look a bit at the details. I am also comparing the experience with that of Peter Cooper who runs the Ruby Weekly which was the inspiration to this newsletter.

   I wrote this article in response to a question I got. I tried to make the comparison related to the job opportunities.

   As an experiment <a href="https://domm.plix.at/">Thomas Klausner (domm)</a> and myself are going to host a 'Mob programming' session on April 2 Thursday at 15:00 UTC (17:00 CET, 8 am PDT). It will run via Zoom and we'll probably use <a href="https://cyber-dojo.org/">Cyber Dojo</a>. It supports Perl 5, though it does not support Raku. Yet. I have hopes that by that time the Raku developers will be able to send a PR to the maintainers of Cyber-Dojo or that we'll have an alternative that also supports Raku. If you are interested to join, send me an e-mail (gabor@szabgab.com), and I'll send you an invitation.

   Ladino, also known as Judeo-Spanish, is the language of the Jews who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula in 1492. It is medieval Spanish mixed with Hebrew, Turkish, Greek, Arabic, Slavic, etc. words. It can be written either with Latin letters or with Hebrew letters. (sample fun word: 'kreatura' meaning small child or baby)

   Once in a while someone sends me an email asking for help with some Perl or Perl/CGI project. I don't have time for such work, even if it is paid, so I usually direct them to Stack Overflow for technical help and jobs.perl.org to find someone to the work for them. Sometimes however I am inspired to write up a technical post that can address their problem in a generic way. This is such a post.
