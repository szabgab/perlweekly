   This is another article I wrote, this time on my own blog, describing my experience with this list. It might be interesting to you if you'd like to look a bit at the details. I am also comparing the experience with that of Peter Cooper who runs the Ruby Weekly which was the inspiration to this newsletter.

   I wrote this article in response to a question I got. I tried to make the comparison related to the job opportunities.

   As an experiment <a href="https://domm.plix.at/">Thomas Klausner (domm)</a> and myself are going to host a 'Mob programming' session on April 2 Thursday at 15:00 UTC (17:00 CET, 8 am PDT). It will run via Zoom and we'll probably use <a href="https://cyber-dojo.org/">Cyber Dojo</a>. It supports Perl 5, though it does not support Raku. Yet. I have hopes that by that time the Raku developers will be able to send a PR to the maintainers of Cyber-Dojo or that we'll have an alternative that also supports Raku. If you are interested to join, send me an e-mail (gabor@szabgab.com), and I'll send you an invitation.

You can see the recordings and you can follow me on Twitch (and then you can set it up to send you alerts when I start streaming). I plan to stream frequently in two timeslots. Around 08:00 UTC and 18:00 UTC. I'd love to see you follow me and join me in some of the sessions.
