   Yanick Champoux (yanick), in his usual colorful way, describes how he wrote a plugin for Dancer to handle postal fees in Canada. I am sure if it can be done in Canada it can be done elsewhere as well. The nice thing is that he even provides a way to save money. Even if not on the actual postal fees.

   <a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog/entry/test-dancer-plugins">Mass-Testing Dancer's Plugins (by Yanick Champoux)</a><br>
   The Dancer is currently under a rewrite that will include certain API changes. Yanick Champoux took upon the task to test all the plugins Dancer has - more-or-less all the modules that depend on Dancer - and run their tests with both Dancer 1 and Dancer 2. They should work. There were 37 modules that passed on Dancer 1 but not on Dancer 2, and there were a few (I think 5) that failed on both versions of Dancer. That's, out of 76 distributions Yanick found.

   <a href="http://babyl.ca/techblog/entry/sharedir-tarball">ShareDir Without The Leftover Blues</a><br>
   When upgrading a module, the CPAN client does not know how to remove the old, unnecessary files. This can be especially problematic with external files such as images used as icons. Yanick Champoux created Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball that will allow you to distribute all the shared files as a single tar.gz file. He also created File::ShareDir::Tarball that will allow you to later find the files installed inside that zip file. It should be a drop-in replacement for File::ShareDir.

   <a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog/entry/statement-toggler">Statement Toggler for Vim</a><br>
   Yanick Champoux wrote a simple perl script that can switch between 'if (cond) {statement}' and 'statement if cond', one of the possible refactorings in Perl. He hooked it up to vim, but if the code is released both as a stand-alone script, and as a module, then it could be used in other editors and IDEs as well.
