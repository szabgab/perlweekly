   <a href="http://ldami.blogspot.com/2011/08/about-msofficewordhtmlwriter.html">Creating Microsoft Word documents at Geneva courts of law with Perl only</a><br>
   Laurent Dami (dami) introduces MsOffice::Word::HTML::Writer that is used at the Geneva courts of law to create Microsoft Word documents from HTML files. It only needs Perl so it can run on Linux machines as well.

   <a href="http://ldami.blogspot.com/2011/08/beautiful-riga.html">Beautiful Riga</a><br>
   Laurent Dami (dami) writes mostly about the city where YAPC::EU took place and not so much about the conference itself.

   <a href="http://ldami.blogspot.com/2012/02/plat-forms-2012-perl-on-amazon-web.html">Plat-forms 2012 : Perl on Amazon Web Services ?</a><br>
   Laurent Dami (dami) started to prepare for the next Plat-forms competition that will take place in April in Berlin, but he is worried. Will the apparent lack of Perl on AWS make it hard for the Perl team to compete? Is there a lack of Perl on AWS? What do you think?

   <a href="http://ldami.blogspot.com/2012/05/who-is-using-regexpgrammars.html">Who is using Regexp::Grammars ?</a><br>
   Just a few hours after the above post, Laurent Dami tells us he has been using Regexp::Grammars for some project but thinks too few CPAN modules use it. Why?

   <a href="http://ldami.blogspot.com/2012/11/updated-datadomain-and-new-testindomain.html">Updated Data::Domain and new Test::InDomain</a><br>
   Data::Domain is an input verification module, especially for web applications, while Test::InDomain is a wrapper around the former allowing writing specialized tests of deep data structures.

   <a href="http://ldami.blogspot.com/2012/12/hash-key-order-beware-of-implicit.html">Hash key order : beware of implicit assumptions</a><br>
   In every Perl training class I try to make sure people understand that they can never ever rely on the order keys() returns the keys of a hash. This was hard as in the trivial cases the values always returned in the same order. As you can see in this article, even expert Perl programmers might have used this assumption. This will all change when 5.18 is released as the hash keys will be now further randomized. Expect some (incorrect) code to start breaking.

   <a href="http://ldami.blogspot.com/2014/06/perl-smartmatch-what-now.html">Perl smartmatch : what now ?</a><br>
   Laurent Dami raised the frustrating question. You know, the smartmatch operator and the given/when pair that were introduced in perl 5.10 have been marked as experimental in 5.18 and it is not clear how they might change in the future. A few suggestions how to deal with the problem.

   <a href="http://ldami.blogspot.com/2014/07/project-perl-virtual-tables-for.html">Perl virtual tables for DBD::SQLite </a><br>
   Dami wants to generate SQLite virtual tables from within Perl. From the comment section, it seems that he won't even have to roll up his sleeves: SQLite::VirtualTable might already provide all that he needs.
</li>

   <a href="http://ldami.blogspot.com/2014/07/perl-virtual-tables-for-dbdsqlite-ready.html">Perl virtual tables for DBD::SQLite : ready to test</a><br>
   Laurent Dami continues on his quest for Perl-based virtual table support for SQLite. This time around, he has a working prototype to share with us.

   <a href="http://ldami.blogspot.com/2014/07/plackapp-namespace-is-not-for-apps-so.html">Plack::App::* namespace is not for apps - so which is the proper CPAN namespace ?</a><br>
   Laurent Dami is trying to navigate among the various contradicting 'CPAN naming principles'. How should you name your module? How should you name an application? Can it be uploaded to CPAN? - My take on the subject: use a branded top-level name and don't rely only on CPAN as distribution channel. Also build stand-alone packages that can be downloaded from the branded(!) web site of the project.

   Laurent Dami was skeptical about the Swiss Perl Workshop.

   DBIx::DataModel is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for building Perl abstractions. The article explains some of its advantages.
