   v5.19.9 the latest development release of Perl edging toward 5.20 already has an experimental feature called 'signatures'.

   Last week, after sharing the previous article of David Farrell about the Shell voulnaribility and its impact on Perl, we got quite a few comments explaining that the article did not take into account mod_perl/cgi/something else. I am far from being an expert on security and Bash and this particular issue, so I am not sure this is a complete and correct solution, but I think it is definitely good to see solutions in Perl to problems not caused by Perl.

   By default vim, as most of the other editors, recognize the type of a file based on their extension. Because the in many cases the file extension of Perl 5 and Perl 6 files are the same, vim keeps trying to use the Perl 5 syntax highlighter on Perl 6 files, and fails. David has a couple of suggestions, including looking at the content of the file, to recognize that it is a Perl 6 file. He also provides the vim script for this.

   What is a number? Is 2.3 a number? Is 0.3 a number? What about .3 or 2. - are those considered numbers? It all depends who do you ask. Perl comes with Scalar::Util that has a function called 'looks_like_number' that I think embodies this question. Perl won't commit to declare that the given string is indeed a number in your univers. It just say it looks like one. David explains the problems with this function and shows other ways to check if a string is indeed a number.

   <a href="https://perldotcom.perl.org/article/the-trouble-with-reference-counting/">The Trouble with Reference Counting</a><br>
   Perl uses a simple form of garbage collection (GC) called reference counting. Every variable created by a Perl program has a refcnt associated with it. If the program creates a reference to the variable, Perl increments its refcnt. Whenever Perl exits a block it reclaims any variables that belong to the block scope. If any are references, their referenced values' refcnt are either decremented or they're reclaimed as well if no other references to them remain.
