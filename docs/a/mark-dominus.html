   <a href="http://blog.plover.com/prog/perl/DateTime-Moonpig.html">DateTime::Moonpig, a saner interface to DateTime </a><br>
   Some epic projects also bring fortuitous collateral goodies. The space race gave us disposable diapers, Moonpig, and a more rational interface to the powerful DateTime module. Mark J Dominus makes the case for it.

   <a href="http://blog.plover.com/2014/02/08/">Everything needs an ID </a><br>
   Why? Because it's usually simple to do, and makes things easy. Mark Dominus makes the case for the ever-useful unique identifier.

   <a href="http://blog.plover.com/lang/threnodials.html">My brush with Oulipo</a><br>
   Mark Jason Dominus reminisces about his brush with Oulipo, a society of writers that takes delight in "constrained writing", which is not totally unlike code golfing with natural languages.

   <a href="http://blog.plover.com/law/contracts.html">A public service announcement about contracts </a><br>
   Some excellent advice from Mark, about the right response when someone asks you to sign a contract with a clause that's only there because the lawyers wanted it. He followed it up with some <a href="http://blog.plover.com/law/contracts-2.html">examples</a>.

   <a href="http://blog.plover.com/prog/unfinished-projects.html">Want to work with me on one of these projects? </a><br>
   Mark lists some of his unfinished projects. He's hoping some of us might be interested in working on these, either with Mark or not.

   <a href="http://blog.plover.com/prog/monad-search-2.html">The list monad in Perl and Python </a><br>
   Mark wrote a Perl version of a previous <a href="http://blog.plover.com/prog/haskell/monad-search.html">Haskell program</a> using a list monad to solve a cryptarithm puzzle. In writing this I decided I should find out what a monad is. I found various pages declaring themselves to be simple explanations of monads, but I'm not sharing the links here, because I still don't understand monads :-)

   <a href="http://perl.plover.com/yak/HashHistory/">Historical how and why of hash tables</a><br>
   A 35 min presentation by MJD together with the slides explaining what are hash tables (dictionaries for Python programmers), how they really work, and why do we have them.

   <a href="http://blog.plover.com/oops/three-errors.html">How I got three errors into one line of code</a><br>
   Mark talks us through the problems he had with one line of code.

   <a href="http://blog.plover.com/math/24-puzzle.html">Solving twenty-four puzzles </a><br>
   Back in July of last year, Mark blogged about a type of puzzle that his kids were having fun with. Here he talks through the design of his solution, and links to his Perl code.

   <a href="https://blog.plover.com/prog/compiler-error.html">No, it is not a compiler error. It is never a compiler error.</a><br>
   Spoiler alert: It was a compiler error.
