   <a href="http://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/blog/1283">Use a Task distribution to specify groups of modules</a><br>
   brian d foy writes: A Task distribution is like a normal Perl distribution in structure, but it doesn't actually provide any code. It lists as pre-requisites all of the modules or distributions that you want to install...

   The wide characters warning is a very annoying thing. Especially when it comes from a third party module. In many cases you don't have control over how that module handles and prints data. In this article brian d foy shows how you can tell Log4perl to use utf8 when printing to the screen or to some other channel.

   brian d foy is thinking on some new tools to teach Perl to beginners and he is asking your opinion. Having a Virtual-Box image of Linux already filled with all the necessary tools is a good idea, I have been doing that with my test automation classes. I hope, for people who prefer Windows he will pick DWIM Perl for Windows and Padre. They were built with the idea that they can be a smoother entry for people in the Windows world.

It can be fun to just show up at the conference and go with the flow, but it might be a lot better to plan ahead. Not only picking the talks you'd like to hear but trying to figure out what other social events would you like to attend and who you would like to talk to.

   Originally suggested by brian d foy, MDK wants to take the idea of 'Lunch with a celebrity' one step further and get it more organized. I personally had ambivalent feelings about the Lunch project when brian asked if I'd like to participate. I don't think I am a 'celebrity' though I certainly make a lot of noise so relatively many people heard my name. OTOH, I like to have lunch with and talk to new people.

   I think LinkedIN provides a great platform to find potential employees, employers, clients or service providers.

It is only a click away. brian d foy explains the new feature and recommends that you use it. I am not sure how to really encourage people to do that, but I do think it can be an important factor in finding good Perl developers.

   Andrew Shitov asked for 10,000 USD to 'Create a complete course of the Perl 6 programming language.' In a close vote it was rejected, partially due to the lack of specifics about deployment and hosting options. brian d foy that the hosting question should not be important as the expense is negliable. I tend to agee. One could run a decent system on a 5-10 USD/month box on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=0d4cc75b3a74">Digital Ocean</a> that would probably server the Perl 6 users if their number 10 and probably even 100 times more than the current number. If that happens I am sure there will be individuals or companies who will be happy to pay the bill. On the other hand I think the plan for deployment should be part of the grant and the system needs to be deployed from day 1.
