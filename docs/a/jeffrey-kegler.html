   Jeffrey Kegler, in his Ocean of Awareness explains the 'use' statement of Perl. Probably way more than you'd every want to know about it. Unless of course, you would like to understand how it works. It's not easy so Jeffrey get some help from the Wizard of Oz.

   The Marpa parser for grammars is now fully implemented in C. Jeffrey Kegler keeps working on Marpa which is great. He also keeps blogging that makes it easy to report about the new releases.

   Jeffrey Kegler pitches his Marpa engine against the regex engine of Perl. He says that in some cases Marpa is much faster than any regex could be. Then a discussion with Tom Christiansen makes the whole article even more interesting.

   In this post Jeffrey Kegler talks about problems where parsing has been avoided. As I understand that mostly means areas where we try to use regular expressions to extract information. We might call it parsing but we won't use the words 'grammar' or 'language' when describing the thing that needs to be parsed.

   Jeffrey Kegler has released Marpa::R2, and I am wondering when D2 will be added. Anyway, what I really like is the 'situational awareness' that helps providing better error messages for when the parsing fails. That's actually one of the major issues I see with regexes: how do you know why it has not matched. This might be a better solution.

   If I understand it correctly, Jeffrey Kegler is solving the auto-threading problem for grammars. You write the grammar and Marpa will be able to execute it (or parts of it) on multiple cores without you doing extra work. Well, of course you first need to understand how Marpa works and how to build a grammar for it.

   In this articles, there is way more than I ever wanted to know about HTML, and the specification of HTML. The thing is, that someone has to know if text is allowed immediately inside <body> tags, or if there needs to be another element. Eg. <p>. Jeffrey Kegler discusses the topic, and using his Marpa project provides a parser to deal with the problem.

   In the post on procedural parsing, the subparsers were like combinators, in that they could be called recursively, so that a parse could be built up from components. Like combinators, each child could return, not just a parse, but a set of parses. And, as in combinators, once a child combinator returned its value, the parent parser could resume parsing at a location specified by the child combinator.
