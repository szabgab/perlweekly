   <a href="http://bulknews.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/on-perl-and-backward-compatibilities.html">On Perl and backward compatibilities</a><br>
   There is a tension between wanting to keep backward compatibility and developing Perl or a CPAN module fast. Tatsuhiko Miyagawa gives a good example pointing out the issue in the dependency chain and then points to 'carton', his solution for the problem.

   When you deploy an application you want to make sure you have the exact same dependencies on all the machines you are using. Tatsuhiko Miyagawa gave a presentation about Carton, his new tool for dependency management.

   Tatsuhiko Miyagawa continues to steal ideas from Ruby. This time he is proposing cpanfile - a way to declare and manage CPAN dependencies in an application.

   Perl 5.16 and 5.16.1 are shipped with a developer release of ExtUtils::MakeMaker and there is no newer version CPAN. This sometimes breaks Carton. Tatsuhiko Miyagawa is a nice guy, so he phrases in a very nice way how p5p and the authors of the core modules could avoid such problems. I am just surprised how can this happen? Why is there no policy in p5p that they only ship with productions modules that have been released to CPAN?

   Carton, another beautiful creation of Tatsuhiko Miyagawa, is a tool to bundle CPAN modules with your application. To make sure all the developers use the same version of the modules and that you can then release your application relying on a specific set of CPAN module/version pairs.
