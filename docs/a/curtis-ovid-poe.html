   It is a bit unclear to me why did Ovid give this title while it seems the interesting part of his blog entry was the Perl script that highlights the character where a json file has a syntax error. The funny thing is that the Perl Weekly is based on a JSON file and I am writing it in Padre. So I already wanted to write a plugin to do syntax checking of JSON files. Now I can just take what Ovid wrote.

It would be nice if some good soul took a look at that module as I probably won't have much time for it.

   One of the biggest problem I encounter when starting to clean up legacy code, is locating and eliminating duplicate code.

   What happens when your co-worker left the code in a broken state and he is gone for 2 weeks during the holidays? how do you avoid the constant nagging of the failing tests, and how do you make sure you don't get used to them saying 'Oh we expect those to fail...'. As usual Ovid comes with an interesting solution, though I think I'd stick to TODO block + big red sticker on co-workers screen.

   Ovid continues his thoughts on the balance between the need for 'well tested code' and 'useful code'. In other settings people say 'making more money for the business is the only important thing', but what are the limits? Ovid uses the expressions 'do no harm' and 'mitigate harm' and 'ethical choice'. Where do you stand? Where does the company you work for stands?

   The grep test basically means that you should be able to grep for any meaningful string in your code base to find out the usage of those keywords. This sounds like a very reasonable approach and a good way to explain it, but what would you do if you had a piece of code where you get the name of a method passed to you and you call that method using the variable name?

   There are a lot of good points in this post, but Ovid also writes: "Though support for a rename was overwhelming, there was a loud minority who objected", but he shows no evidence of this. For all I know there were 8 billion people who silently supported the name change and 20 'loudmouthes' who were actually involved in the project who opposed it. I don't know. It just seems like bending the truth. It is definitely trumping on the people who 'lost' the argument. Then giving them a bone by writing: "But through it all, one thing remained clear: everyone meant well.". And all this is coming from a well-respected member of the Perl community.

   The little I understand the state of programming, I think there is a trend going towards more immutable objects. In Perl there are not many such objects, even constants are just functions. So it will be interesting to see how this works out. Will having immutables reduce the bugs in our code as promised by many or will it just increase the complexity?
