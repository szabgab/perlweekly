   Once upon a time, Doug Bell decided to start a new project. At the time, he also opted to write it in a language that he had no experience in, despite the fact that there was a quite real time constraint involved. Now that the wounds have healed, he shares his experience with us.

   Copy-pasting code snippets is very unpleasant. The Modern::Perl module addresses this issue, but introduces some other possible problems. Import::Base makes it easy to create modules similar to Modern::Perl that will import a number of other modules to fit your preferences. This might not be a good idea in a publicly released module, but it might be useful in a closed environment, such as an in-house project of a company where you supposed to have better control over the code anyway.

   I did not know what a runbook is, I guess it is something others call a checklist. What I do know is that I agree about the problems with Jenkins and I'd love to see something like this being developed. It can be an excellent tool for SREs and people whom are often called DevOps engineers. IMHO, in order to make it catch on it needs its own web-site that is not MetaCPAN. It needs to have an installation that does not require any knowledge of Perl. These are two big areas where others could help the project. Of course 'just' using it and reporting any issues would also be extremely valuable.
