   preaction is using the Git::Repository Perl module to create releases both at Double Cluepon and at Bank of America. The comment section is also interesting. It shows how blog posting can lead to interaction between CPAN authors and users.

   Once upon a time, Doug Bell decided to start a new project. At the time, he also opted to write it in a language that he had no experience in, despite the fact that there was a quite real time constraint involved. Now that the wounds have healed, he shares his experience with us.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/preaction/2014/10/managing-boilerplate-with-importbase.html">Managing Boilerplate with Import::Base</a><br>
   Copy-pasting code snippets is very unpleasant. The Modern::Perl module addresses this issue, but introduces some other possible problems. Import::Base makes it easy to create modules similar to Modern::Perl that will import a number of other modules to fit your preferences. This might not be a good idea in a publicly released module, but it might be useful in a closed environment, such as an in-house project of a company where you supposed to have better control over the code anyway.
