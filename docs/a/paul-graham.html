   <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/work.html">What Doesn't Seem Like Work?</a><br>
   A short essay from Paul, with a key insight: "If something that seems like work to other people doesn't seem like work to you, that's something you're well suited for. For example, a lot of programmers I know, including me, actually like debugging. [...] The stranger your tastes seem to other people, the stronger evidence they probably are of what you should do."

   <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html">Write like you talk</a><br>
   Simple but good advice from the founder of Y-Combinator: when writing (he's talking mainly about blogs, but I think this applies to documentation and elsewhere), you should write like you talk.
