   I probably met Stuart at one of the Perl conferences, though unfortunately I am really bad recalling names so I don't remember. (Sorry, Stuart.) Worse than that I don't have his name in my e-mail archive nor is he in my LinkedIn contact list that could remind me. I could not find any of his blog posts mentioned in the Perl Weekly, not even the whyperl.info he links to. I am surprised we have not bumped into it nor has anyone asked the editors of the Perl Weekly to include that site. If you know him, please comment on the TPF nomination page so we can also get to know him. If you have any questions to him, ask that so we can know about his thoughts more before he becomes the president of The Perl Foundation.
