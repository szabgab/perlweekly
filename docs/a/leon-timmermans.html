   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/leon_timmermans/2011/10/why-do-you-want-new-major-features-in-core.html">Why do you want new major features in core?</a><br>
   Some people complain that 5.12 and 5.14 have not added many new user visible features to Perl. Leon Timmermans asks why do we want them. I think the more interesting question would be 'What new features do you want in core Perl?' and that's what some people answered. That's what you should also consider and post as a comment.

   Do you want to risk a seg-fault in your code? Leon Timmermans shows how safe and unsafe signal handles work and explains what are the problems with either of those.

   <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Slurper">File::Slurper</a><br>
   Leon Timmermans released <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Slurper">File::Slurper</a>, previously known as File::Slurp::Sane. It's intended as a replacement for <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Slurp">File::Slurp</a>, which has a number of <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=File-Slurp">problems</a>.

   Instead of that module Leon suggests <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Slurper">File::Slurper</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Path::Tiny">Path::Tiny</a>, or even <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::All">IO::All</a>. I personally think that this whole thing, including the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/3hfsqt/fileslurp_is_broken_and_wrong/">discussion on Reddit</a> indicate serious problems in the Perl culture. How many people will see this post? How will all the others know what is the recommended way to slurp a file into memory?

   A breaking change is happening for many developers in 5.27.7, it seems; I'm still learning about this one, and what it'll mean for my own coding. Lots of comments--get involved, and talk to the core devs you know!

   Thought provoking. Though I think Perl 5 has not been as backward compatible as many people like to think. I've seen quite a few upgrades breaking things. I like some of the comments: I like the point preaction makes between certainity and uncertainty. I also like the poins of Dean make about democracy or lack thereof. There are even more comments on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/i1qqxa/perl7_is_a_fork_of_values/">Reddit thread</a>.
