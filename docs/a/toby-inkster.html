   Toby Inkster introduces 'Ask', a new module that does its darnedest to interact with the user. No interactive prompt? I'll try to use Tk, Wx, Gtk2 or even zenity widgets to get its questions across. And it's meant to be easily extended, so that if everything else fails, you can still write your own ESP plugin.

   Have you ever dealt with data structures that were too large to fit in your screen? Or do you have 1024 inch screen? Toby Inkster created a module that you can use as a simple replacement of Data::Dumper inside your code, and that will open a window, a real desktop GUI window(!) where you can drill down in your data structure. After installing the module you could already try it with this statement as well:   perl -MData::Dumper::GUI -e 'Dumper {%INC}' to see which modules are loaded by perl and by Data::Dumper::GUI together.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/toby_inkster/2013/09/-welcome-to-the-first.html">Planet Moose - August 2013</a><br>
   Toby Inkster started a monthly writeup of what's happening in the world of Moose and related modules. That is covering the (relatively) new breed of OOP frameworks of Perl. In this first edition, he mentioned Mouse, Moo, Moops, Class::Tiny, p5-mop and a bunch of MooseX::* modules.

   As Toby Inkster explains: 'Acme-oop-ism is about writing code that works in Moose, Mouse and Moo.' His work allows the deprecation of several modules in favor of one that can handle all 3 OOP systems.

   Toby Inkster continues his quest to unify the way we can use Moose, Moo and Mouse. One of his suggestion is to write for Moo. Code written using Moo works well with Moose as well, and the syntactic sugar alll three provide is quite similar. So if you use that, your code will likely work with all 3.

   The original intention of Type::Tiny written by Toby Inkster was to provide a framework for attribution to Moose-style class builders, but can also be used for sub parameter validation, switch-like statements, tied arrays, and probably more. Now that it is getting closer to its major release, Toby is looking for more use-cases that might bring in more test-cases to the unit tests of Type::Tiny. That will help in ensuring stability of the API after the 1.0 release.

   Toby Inkster argues that Test::Most is old, has some outdated dependencies and cannot be changed because modules depend on it. Hence he released Test::Modern with a set of dependencies that are good now. I applaud the recommendations, but I think this is not a good path. IMHO it would be better to find a way to update Test::Most.

   It is interesting to see how Perl, a language that lets you throw any kind of value at it and it does something with it, usually what you meant, got so many 3rd party libraries that help you restrict the type of values you accept. It shows that we like flexibility and strictness at the same time. BTW there was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/aervtw/how_to_balance_perls_flexibility_and_type/">discussion</a> about the subject last week.
