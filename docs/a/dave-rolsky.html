   <a href="http://blog.urth.org/2011/08/conference-code-of-conduct-considerations.html">Conference Code of Conduct Considerations</a><br>
   The discussion around code of conduct for conferences has surfaced on several Perl related web sites recently. In this article, Dave Rolsky goes into more depth about the topic. As this is relevant to all YAPCs and Perl Workshops, if you are planning to attend or organize such event it might be better to voice your opinion now than to complain later.

   <a href="http://blog.urth.org/2011/09/my-new-oo-docs-for-the-perl-core-have-been-merged.html">The New OO Docs of Dave Rolsky for the Perl Core Have Been Merged</a><br>
   After many months of working the new OOP docs written by Dave Rolsky finally reached the point when they could be merged into the core perl documentation. This means they will be part of the next official release of perl. If you are impatient to wait you can check out his blog entry and from there the link to the documentation.

   Dave Rolsky has released Perl 5.15.6, the latest development version of Perl. Each release includes an epigraph. Dave explains his choice.

   <a href="http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/487216/8491ce8b050bfd59/">Perl 5.16 and beyond</a><br>
   Dave Rolsky has written an article for LWN, and it is already publicly available. He describes the possibility to extend the syntax of Perl outside of the core and how this will help fixing the smart-match operator while retaining the old and not so perfect behavior for people who want that. (for backward compability). All this without messing up the core of perl. He also talks about some of the plans for the development of Perl.

   <a href="http://blog.urth.org/2012/04/git-age-report.html">git-age-report</a><br>
   Dave Rolsky provides a nice solution in Perl to find the files in a git repository, that have not been changed for a long time. But then it got golfed to some really short solution using find and xargs. Of course the latter won't work on Windows.

   Dave Rolsy picked up the theme from last week and has a solution for all the companies that find it hard to hire good Perl developers. Allow telecommuting. One of the comments mention that offering a decent salary is also a good idea...

   So what do you say, should Perl projects have a standard style? Should they pick one from several standard styles? Is it OK to use your personal coding style in an Open source project? What about within a company?

   Now with the CPAN Pull Request challenge going on, it is very interesting to read why a module author has delayed accepting a pull-request and how it lead to the creating of HTML::Differences that can find real differences between two HTML snippets.

   Dave's been playing with Perl a bit recently, and shares some of the things he likes. In summary: "Pretty much everything I love in Perl 5 is still part of Perl 6, but almost everything I hate is gone too".
