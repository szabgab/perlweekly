   How do you say 117? Is that 'one hundred and seventeen' or is that 'one hundred seventeen'? This is another great in-depth comparison article by Neil Bowers. This time he checked 4 modules on CPAN for the time when you'd like to use letters instead of numbers. It is limited to English. I wonder if there are similar modules in other languages as well?

   Another excellent post by Neil Bowers comparing modules to parse the User-Agent strings passed by browsers to web servers. It sounds like a simple problem but due to the 'interesting' decisions made by the browser authors it became an annoyance. Having so many different solutions to this problem just adds to the confusion so I think it is great Neil compared them and recommended one.

I am looking forward to the day when his reports will be somehow available on the search interfaces of CPAN. E.g. when a module that he lists is being displayed there could be a link to his article.

   Neil Bowers brought up an idea, that, if I understand it correctly, basically would be a way to allow you to finance the development of features or the fixing of bugs in CPAN modules or other open source Perl projects. I think this is a very good initiative. What do you think? Will you use it?

   Every once in a while people come along various Perl channels, mailing lists and forums and ask what perl project they could be involved. Neil Bowers is now trying to set up some metric that will show which CPAN modules need the most attention. Some metric based on the number of bugs, the age of bugs, the date of most recent release etc. Among the comments you can also find the process, to take over maintainership of a module.

   Sometime you'd want to delay loading  module to save on start-up time, or to save on memory footprint, or because you can only decided which modules to load at run time. Or for some other reason. There are plenty of solutions for this problem. Neil Bowers went through quite a few of those and compared them.

   Neil Bowers, who moved to his own blogging engine, disliked some code examples I wrote the day before. He might be right with his criticism. How do you like the following code? printf q{'%s'

   Another awesome review by Neil Bowers. (... and his site looks better and better!). Markdown is a simple language, one could say markup language, if it wasn't markdown, that can help you write simple text with a few marks and then turn it into some other format such as HTML. Apparently there are several Perl modules that can handle the Markdown format. Which one is the best?

   Every module on CPAN can have a single line 'abstract' that shows up in many places. This is the 'elevator pitch' of the module. The single line most people will see before they decide to further investigate your module or skip it. So Neil Bowers explains how you can make it better so the biggest number of people can benefit from your work. (Or easily decide that this is not what they need.)

   Neil Bowers reminds us that CPAN is not an immutable entity that exists independently of everything. It's literally the sum and beating heart of the community, and ultimately what we'll all be able to take out of it is what we all, individually, put in it.

   I wanted to do something like this for ages, I am glad Neil Bowers had the same idea and went for it. He created a metric that after some more tweaking will help identify which CPAN modules need some help, maybe even adoption. If you were wondering where could you contribute to Perl, look at the list and try to pick a module from there.

   <a href="http://neilb.org/2013/08/07/adoptme.html">Marking modules as 'available for adoption'</a><br>
   It is very easy to upload new modules to CPAN and it is not too difficult to take over maintainership of a module, but this usually only happens after a long period of inactivity on that module. How can a module author indicate that she is no longer interested in the maintenance of the module and that she is looking for someone to step in? While there is no special mechanism for this, Neil Bowers explains what is the accepted way to mark a module to be looking for a new maintainer.

   I found four Perl-related 'GitHub organizations' where several people maintain a few Perl modules together. If you know about more organizations, please let me know. If you are looking for a module to contribute to, but you prefer working together with others, then checking out these modules might be better than the list Neil Bowers generates. Or, you could take one of the modules from the list of Neil's and bring it to a Github organization.

   Neil Bowers explains why a package uploaded to CPAN should use a single namespace and its subnames only. So if you upload Foo-Bar it should only contain Foo::Bar and modules in Foo::Bar::* and not something like 'Config'. I you need a module for configuration, that should be Foo::Bar::Config.

   There are more than 8000 CPAN modules that depend indirectly on this module. Neil Bowers, the new maintainer released a new version of Perl::MinimumVersion, that broke some of the dependent modules. I think he is way to hard on himself, but the really interesting part is the list of ways he proposes to reduce the chance breaking the chain for other people. If you are a CPAN author, or if you are going to be a CPAN author, then these points can help reducing anxiety.

   The CPAN testing network could be argue to be the awesome marrow that is one of the prime factors  that makes the CPAN skeleton so strong. But, of course, this testing network is not run magically by elves. Neil Bowers takes time to tip his hat to Chris Williams, who reported this month his 20th million test report.

   Chris Williams (aka BINGOS) is another of those elder members of the Perl community. He maintains an impressive number of modules deadling with the testing toolchain, the Windows environment, Dist-Zilla and the asynchronous POE framework. He's also one of the most, if not THE most, active CPAN tester. Neil Bowers points out in an article this month that Chris reported his twentieth million smoke test, an accomplishment that is quite awe-inspiring.

   As the Hacktoberfest got more popular it started to generate more and more tiny, many times meaningless pull-requests. I received a few of them. Instead of creating values, this started to become a burden for many authors. Now they changed the rules so you need to opt-in your repository or, as far as I understand, you can also mark a pull-request as 'valid for hacktoberfest'. I really hope this isn't an overshooting in the other direction. In any case, Neil explains what you can do to opt-in your GitHub repo.

   CPAN RP is an indicator how many other modules depend on. It is nice to draw this, but I don't really know what conclusions can be drawn about any relationship between these two values. What does it really mean if a distribution has not been released for years. Is it abandoned? Is it (almost) perfect so that no serious bugs exists that would be worth the effort of the release? What does it mean if something was released 2 weeks ago? What if this happened after a 5-year break?
