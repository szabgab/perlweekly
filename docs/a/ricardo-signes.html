   Rik, who has been the Pumpking of Perl 5 for 4.5 years, has now decided to move on. Apparently, not everyone was happy with the job Rik did, but I think it is more than unfortunate that some people decide to attack him now in some comments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/4etcq4/rik_signes_to_step_down_as_pumpking/">Reddit</a>.

   <a href="https://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/2124">adding the perl-support section to my CPAN modules </a><br>
   P5P has been working on new features for Perl and the CPAN authors had to refrain from using those as they were expected to 'support' old versions of Perl for organizations that don't support the Perl ecosystem and have no intention to upgrade the Perl they use. (In which case, IMHO they should also stick to the old versions of the modules that ran on their version of Perl.) Ricardo now takes the leap and makes it explicit that he is not going to waste his free time doing so.

   Ricardo has 114 distributions on CPAN, give or take a few. (<a href="https://metacpan.org/author/RJBS">MetaCPAN</a> shows 265). He wanted to do some housekeeping that was almost fun. I think one of these cleanup uploads caught my eye thinking that the distribution is actively maintained and I sent him PR adding GitHub Actions probably making him regret a bit the new uploads.

   For a long time I felt that it is not a good idea to want to support people who have not upgraded their version of perl for 5-10-15(!) years, but want the latest modules from CPAN. I am glad RJBS also thinks so. He also writes about it a lot more nicely than I could ever do and gives several ways to handle the situation when a new version of a module starts requiring a version of Perl that is only 10 years old...
