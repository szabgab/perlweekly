   When you look at a module or dist on MetaCPAN or search.cpan.org, they both show the last person who released it. Rik points out that this isn't always the most appropriate person to show, and suggests that the <em>owner</em> of the distribution should be displayed. He also opened a <a href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web/issues/1643">github issue</a> for MetaCPAN, specifically about highlighting when a module has <code>ADOPTME</code>, <code>HANDOFF</code>, or <code>NEEDHELP</code>.

   Rik, who has been the Pumpking of Perl 5 for 4.5 years, has now decided to move on. Apparently, not everyone was happy with the job Rik did, but I think it is more than unfortunate that some people decide to attack him now in some comments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/4etcq4/rik_signes_to_step_down_as_pumpking/">Reddit</a>.
