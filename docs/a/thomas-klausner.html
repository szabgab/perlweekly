   Thomas Klausner (domm) reports that he created a web site for the App::TimeTracker command line time tracker. I have to say they have a very cool demo on the front page and a very nice looking site. I find it very funny that the king of command line is building a nice web site for his command line product but I also find it very encouraging!

   Thomas Klausner (Domm) describes how did APW go for him. There were 25 people, some of them new to the Vienna Perl Mongers. It seems they had fun, which is not surprising to me, and they plan to do it again next year.

   Perl packages have to end with a true value. Typically, that's '1'. But some authors get more... creative. domm sends his module hunting for those peculiar  true values, and aggregates them for our viewing pleasure.

   The ultimate goal of computer science is, as we all know, to produce cool T-shirts. And blow minds. So it stands to reason that the first thing the Austrian Perl Workshop did with the bright new shiny p5-mop was an obsfuscated code-adorned garment. domm, very kindly, translates the arcane scribbling for us.

   After 15 years of work, the current YEF setup is not working too well anymore. Therefore, we would like to invite all people who want to continue to have informative, fun, cool (and maybe slightly crazy) Perl conferences and events in Europe to join us.<p>The mission:<p>Assembly a group of people who are interesting in (and capable of) organizing Perl events in Europe; define tools we can use; share our knowledge; so we can continue to have great Perl Events, with a focus on "the conference previously known as YAPC". Join the <a href="https://lists.yapceurope.org/mailman/listinfo/venue">mailing list</a>!
