   Thomas Klausner (domm) reports that he created a web site for the App::TimeTracker command line time tracker. I have to say they have a very cool demo on the front page and a very nice looking site. I find it very funny that the king of command line is building a nice web site for his command line product but I also find it very encouraging!

   The ultimate goal of computer science is, as we all know, to produce cool T-shirts. And blow minds.

   How can you make sure that your code, in this case <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/CtrlO::Crypt::XkcdPassword">CtrlO::Crypt::XkcdPassword</a> works even if the process forks? For example in a web application. There were two main issues: Initializing the randomness in the parent meant that they generate the same password in all the processes. TAP does not like to be confused. Also, Windows does not like fork.

   After 15 years of work, the current YEF setup is not working too well anymore. Therefore, we would like to invite all people who want to continue to have informative, fun, cool (and maybe slightly crazy) Perl conferences and events in Europe to join us.<p>The mission:<p>Assembly a group of people who are interesting in (and capable of) organizing Perl events in Europe; define tools we can use; share our knowledge; so we can continue to have great Perl Events, with a focus on "the conference previously known as YAPC". Join the <a href="https://lists.yapceurope.org/mailman/listinfo/venue">mailing list</a>!
