   JT Smith continues with his daily post about the upcoming YAPC::NA. He even discovered the YAPC::NA mailing list so to cover everyone with news. He closed the year with a post about National Mustard Museum in Madison.

   JT Smith announced the Google+ page I created for YAPC::NA. If you are interested in updates about the Perl conferences and Workshops in North America, put this page in your circles. I'll re-post the YAPC::NA blog and I'll also post other, related items and about the Perl Workshops in North America.

   What started out as complain about Clone.pm not working properly lead to a discovery that the Data::Printer module which is supposed to be the best data visualization module on CPAN, actually mangles the data in $a and $b. Then the less, that I've been preaching for years: never use $a and $b outside of sort! Not even in simple examples!

   Are you working on a code-based business idea while still employed? Do you have a contract that say 'everything you make, even what you dream at night belongs to your employer'? JT Smith recommends a way out. Without quitting your job.

   JT Smith writes about the MadMongers meeting where they took a bat file (a Windows shell script) and converted it to a Perl script. It became much longer, so besides having fun, I am not sure what is the advantage here. Unless they plan to wrap some of the functionality in modules so they become reusable and then the actual script becomes short again.
