   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/tudor_constantin/2012/03/more-mojolicious-bootstrap-awesomeness.html">More Mojolicious + Bootstrap Awesomeness</a><br>
   Tudor Constantin created some Boilerplate to make it easier to start developing applications with Mojolicious and Bootstrap.

   <a href="http://programming.tudorconstantin.com/2012/03/perl-teasing-challenge.html">Perl Teasing Challenge </a><br>
   In response to my question Tudor Constantin wrote down how he would go about introducing Perl in just a few hours. He takes the promotional aspect while I am not sure that is what *my* clients want to hear. Nevertheless he has a few interesting points in how to talk about Perl.

   <a href="http://programming.tudorconstantin.com/2012/03/cost-of-technical-debt-361-line-of-code.html">The cost of technical debt: 3.61$ / line of code </a><br>
   Tudor Constantin found a research that puts some quantitative measures to the cost of 'technical debt'. I am not sure what the conclusion of this should be. Throwing away the old and partially broken code? Adding automatic tests to the existing application? Nothing? After all we would like to avoid paying that debt.

   <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/04/what-testing-dsls-get-wrong.html">What Testing DSLs Get Wrong</a><br>
   chromatic tells us that he has never been a fan of Behavior Driven Development. He gives his usual, strong opinion about Ruby's Cucumber. This is especially interesting in contrast to the previous article by Tudor Constantin. Personally I have never made use of BDD and I don't know if - as some of its proponents say - it really works. I think, the good old Fit approach can work well.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/tudor_constantin/2012/04/behavior-driven-development-in-perl.html">Behavior Driven Development in Perl</a><br>
   Tudor Constantin is trying to start testing and has been learning about BDD. You will find a number of links here to explanations and slides that might help you evaluate the approach or even get started. I am very interested how this works out for you.

   <a href="http://programming.tudorconstantin.com/2012/04/mojolicious-boilerplate-evolution.html">Mojolicious Boilerplate Evolution </a><br>
   Tudor Constantin tells us the story behind the evolution of the Mojolicious Boilerplate. Some features that were added and lots of plans he has for the project.

   <a href="http://programming.tudorconstantin.com/2012/11/repainting-monastery.html">Repainting the Monastery</a><br>
   Do you use Perl Monks? What do you think about the look-and feel? Is this something you would be happy to use to show how nice and modern is Perl? Tudor Constantin thought otherwise and came up a new design based on Twitter Bootstrap. I am not sure it will make a difference, but I think it would be good to repaint the Monastery.

   <a href="http://programming.tudorconstantin.com/2013/08/prforgecom-for-promoting-perl.html">PRForge.com for promoting Perl </a><br>
   Tudor Constantin has created a tool that can automate the cross-promotion of articles. On one hand I think it would be very important to 'like' and 're-share' more Perl-related posts, on the other hand I am not sure automating this is a good idea. I am certainly interested in seeing how this works out and I'd be interested in reading your opinion about this. So check out the article, sign up to the service and let us know what do you think? If not this, then what will make it easy for you to 'like' and 're-share' more Perl-related articles?

   Tudor Constantin reveals details about the most sacred. His salary. But not only that. He runs a comparison of income and cost of living in a couple of cities.

   2013.11 in <a href="/archive/122.html">#122</a>
   <a href="http://www.builtinperl.com/">Built In Perl</a><br>
   Tudor Constantin has announced a new web site built by Evozon featuring start-up companies that rely on Perl. Do you work for one? Do you own one? Do you want to get featured?

   <a href="http://programming.tudorconstantin.com/2014/04/perl-facebook-authentication-mojolicious.html">Facebook Authentication in Perl with Mojolicious (Lite)</a><br>
   Authentication is one of those complex interaction things that are almost guaranteed to make our heads swim. Fortunately, most web frameworks have helpful plugins to abstract most of the headache away. Here, Tudor Constantin shows us how to deal with Facebook authentication within Mojolicious.

   The image posted on <a href"http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/2c7y5p/perl_in_one_image/">Reddit</a> with an unlimited amount of clever comments. Apparently first posted by Tudor Constantin on <a href="https://twitter.com/tudorconstantin/status/468653061133840385/photo/1">Twitter</a> (another batch of clever comments).

   <a href="http://programming.tudorconstantin.com/2015/01/perl-already-won.html">Perl Already Won</a><br>
   An impassioned support of Perl from Tudor, in response to the <a href="http://outspeaking.com/words-of-technology/why-perl-didnt-win.html">Why Perl Didn't Win</a> post from August last year. Tudor explains why Perl works for him. And that's what it comes down to I think: we're all wired differently, and some programming languages match our wiring better than others. YMMV.

   Larry Wall will be a guest speaker for the 3rd anniversary of Cluj.pm. In other news, Cluj.pm is already 3 years old? Geeee, time sure flies...

   Tudor enthuses about the Pull Request Challenge. I've always liked Tudor.
