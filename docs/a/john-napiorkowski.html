   John Napiorkowski, who is a long time blogger, a CPAN contributor and also a developer at Shutterstock picks up where Carla has left the post and writes about the importance - for the Perl developers and the Perl community in general - to improve our communication with recruiters. He suggested to create a FAQ on perl.org, specifically for recruiters. Sounds like a good idea, though I think there were a couple of attempts already.

   John Napiorkowski has published a 10-minute long survey about the Catalyst web framework. (It is less than 20 questions.) I don't see a dead-line so, I'd recommend you head over and fill it out ASAP, before it is closed.

   Surely more than 300 of the Perl Weekly readers have some opinion (good or bad) on Catalyst? John Napiorkowski is looking for both current users of Catalyst and people who have not used it yet or already left it for some other framework or even some other language. (Though I guess the last group won't read this newsletter anyway.)

   John Napiorkowski put together some general rules a recruiter could follow if s/he wanted to find a very good Perl developer, and maybe this could be a message to other developers: how to make it easier to find a Perl job. The problem is, that the majority of Perl developers do not participate in 'the community' and do not contribute to the open source code-base. I don't know if those people are better or worse Perl programmers than the ones who contribute. One thing is clear. It is harder to evaluate them. Assuming the evaluation is mostly about 'generated code' and not, for example 'ability to cooperate' or 'ability to follow instructions'. Certainly a subject worth exploring.

   After running the Catalyst poll, John Napiorkowski is now discussing what is Catalyst and where it is going? He explains what a 'Product Statement' is, in a way that hopefully can bridge the gap between the technology oriented people and the marketing oriented people and connects that idea to the road-map.

   BUILDARGS allows pre-processing incoming initialization parameters. There are cases when this works well, but as John Napiorkowski shows, there are also cases when it leads to code that's hard to understand and maintain. He suggests a couple of other solutions. For example the factory design pattern or the builder design pattern.
