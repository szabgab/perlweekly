   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/david_cantrell/2011/08/paramsvalidatedependencies.html">Params::Validate::Dependencies</a><br>
   David Cantrel just announced the creation of an extension to Params::Validate. I have not looked at the features so I wonder if it wasn't a better idea to include this within Params::Validate itself?

   CPANdeps, created and maintained by David Cantrell, provides a way to see all the dependencies of any give CPAN distribution along with the success rate of its tests. It helps you identify which ones of the prerquisites of a module might be problematic to install.

   David Cantrell tells about his role as a test engineer. Actually, writing tests is not even his main responsibility. So what is? Helping others to improve their testing competence.

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/david_cantrell/2013/10/software-test-podcast.html">Software Test Podcast</a><br>
   I did not have time to listen to the actual podcast yet, but what David Cantrell writes about the distinction between Quality Control and Quality Assurance is interesting.

   <a href="http://deps.cpantesters.org/">CPANdeps</a> lets you see the test results of all the dependencies of a given module in a single page.

   Usually, we announce new things. This time, however, David Cantrell warns us that CPANdeps and cpXXXan are going down (but only on the 28th, just long enough for a data center move)

   <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/david_cantrell/2014/09/instant-podcasts-in-50-lines-of-perl.html">Instant podcasts, in 50 lines of perl</a><br>
   David Cantrell implements in 50 lines of clean(!) perl what the other application does in 1,300 lines of PHP. True, he uses a few CPAN modules, but hey, loading them also adds to the line count!

   You're probably familiar with David's <a href="http://deps.cpantesters.org">CPANdeps</a> service, but now David has added a service which can show all of a distribution's downstream depenendencies in a tree form. You might think that only 3 other dists are using your dist, but this will show you all the dists relying on yours.

   David released a complete new distribution to figure out what type a scalar is.

   <a href="https://dev.to/drhyde/cpandeps-end-of-life-1pdf">CPANdeps end of life</a><br>
   One of the constant debates among CPAN developers is what's the oldest version of Perl their modules should support. CPANdeps could have made the decision to stop supporting old modules easier as it provided a way for anyone to download the most recent version of a module that can still be used on their ancient version of Perl. David tells us there is an alternative tool for that and so he plans to shut down his site.

   2021.05.20 in <a href="/archive/513.html">#513</a>
   <a href="http://deps.cpantesters.org/">CPANdeps - correction</a><br>
   Apparently two weeks ago I confused CPANdeps with another of David's ex-projects. cpXXXan was the one that provided older versions of modules for older perls.  CPANdeps shows a tree of a module's dependencies, along with test results for your chosen version of perl. The dependency analysis part of that is available on the command line via the `cpandeps` script (distributed with CPAN::FindDependencies) and MetaCPAN shows the first level of dependencies. Since then David found someone to take over maintenance of CPANdeps anyway.

   <a href="https://dev.to/drhyde/perlbrew-improved-23k9">perlbrew improved</a><br>
   perlbrew to better name each build that is based on an arbitrary commit and not on a released version of Perl.

   One of the problems CPAN testers are facing is code that hangs. That just sits there waiting for Godot.
