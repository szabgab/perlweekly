   <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2011/10/adventures-with-soap-using-perl-part-0.html">Adventures with SOAP using Perl: Part 0 ( prelude )</a><br>
   This is the prelude to a 3-part series by Caleb Cushing (xenoterracide) explaining how he implemented a Perl API to the SOAP API of CyberSource which is an on-line payment processing system.

   <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2012/03/simple-scripting-cli-with-expectpm.html">Simple scripting CLI with Expect.pm </a><br>
   Caleb Cushing ( xenoterracide ) shows a really simple command line script and the slightly more complex script that can automate the former. This can be used to automate any command line interface (CLI) or it can be used to test an application that has a CLI. Very useful. I usually teach some of this in my testing class as well.

   <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2012/05/better-exceptions-with-exceptionbase.html">Better Exceptions with Exception::Base</a><br>
   After several rounds of complaining, finally Caleb Cushing seemed to have found a pair of modules that satisfy his needs for throwing and catching exceptions in Perl. Exception::Base for throwing exceptions, and Try::Tiny for catching them. In this article he shows an example how to use them.

   <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2012/11/interface-driven-design.html">Interface Driven Design </a><br>
   An unusual article in the Perl world discussing design of various modules. For example, if you needed non-blocking http request, could you replace LWP::UserAgent by AnyEvent::HTTP::LWP::UserAgent in a third party module? How should the modules be designed so this will be possible?

   <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2012/11/businesscybersource-api-is-stabilizing.html">Business::CyberSource API is stabilizing as of 0.7.x </a><br>
   While personally I'd need more detailed explanation, it is still interesting to read some of the notes Caleb Cushing (xenoterracide) made, explaining the API changes. This module can potentially become a very important piece of software to make it easier to build business ready web sites with Perl.

   <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2014/07/writing-deprecation-notices-in-perl.html">Writing deprecation notices in perl, optionally with Moose</a><br>
   When legacy parts of your code are marked for an upcoming demise, there are several ways to make them issue deprecation notices. Caleb Cushing shows one way to do it using warnings's 'warnif' and (optionally) Moose's method modifiers.

   <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2014/10/10-ways-of-implementing-polymorphism.html">10 ways of implementing Polymorphism</a><br>
   Caleb Cushing reviews the -- fittingly -- many ways that can be used to implement polymorphism.

   <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2015/05/abandoning-all-perl-modules.html">Abandoning all Perl modules</a><br>
   Caleb has stopped using Perl. You can take over modules from him. See <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/34r43k/caleb_cushing_is_abandoning_all_of_his_perl/">more info</a>.

   <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2015/08/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about.html">Falsehoods programmers believe about versions</a><br>
   Inspired by a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/doing-terrible-things-to-your-code/">blog post</a> by <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/">Jeff Atwood</a>, Caleb put together of falsehoods that programmers sometimes believe about version numbers.

   <a href="https://xenoterracide.com/post/from-perl-to-java/">From Perl to Java</a><br>
   For some very pragmatic and understandable reasons, Caleb made the transition from Perl to Java, and here he shares some of his thoughts on that.
