Beyond the specific issue, the question is what should the module name describe? The technology it implements? The problem it solves? Should it be some unrelated name, just to be nice and interesting?

   I think there are lots of Content Management Systems written in Perl, but none of them are really well known. Now that Joel Berger has released his new CMS, I wonder if this can break into the world of high-profile CMSes? Does Joel want to invest the time and energy in the promotion part as well? Does he want to make a business around it?

   In his analysis, Joel Berger first covers a few reasons why people might dislike Mojolicious, but then he takes the opposite stand. He thinks that Mojolicious acts like a gateway-drug. The thing that can handed to people (and companies) that are afraid of CPAN. Once they tasted it and liked it you can now offer them more CPAN modules.

   Galileo is a CMS written by Joel Berger, but the main point of interest in this article is how he found out - without a lot of SQL knowledge - the way to handle changes in the schema. It is frightening. Especially on a live, public facing system. How can you make drastic changes to your database, without interrupting service?

   As Joel Berger explains, when you upgrade a module, sometimes you want to make sure old files from the previous installations are all gone. This is what the Module::Build plugin accomplishes. There is something that looks similar in both major toolchains, but that is actually a complementary operation. Frankly, I wish this was also part of the toolchains and not some extra module.

   Joel Berger starts the series of articles by asking the question: 'Why should I chose Mojolicious versus one of the other major Perl web frameworks?'. His point is that just as Node.js, Mojolicious was also designed non-blocking in mind. He then goes ahead and shows two versions of a pastebin application.

   Joel explains that there are two different method chaining styles. In one case methods return the objects they acted upon allowing the user to call another method of the same class. The other one is when a method returns an object of some different type so that you can chain a method of that object after the first call. I don't see a huge difference, but he gives an example for the latter in the Mojolicious world.

Routing (and Rendering):  Mojolicious now prevents applications from using reserved placeholders in routes. Logging: Mojolicious now is capable of sanely using a contextual logger. Mojolicious now comes with proxy helpers. Mojo::DOM CSS selector to conditionally match an element based on a property of its children.
