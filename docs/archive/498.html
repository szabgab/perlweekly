        Hi there
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        I am sure you have seen the news of perl.com domain being hacked. It came as a shock to me when someone first reported it on Twitter. Initially, I thought it must be a bad joke. But then I saw a tweet from brian d foy about it. I had to believe the story then. There was so much speculation going around, not all in a good taste. If you want an accurate update on the subject then I would recommend you check out the official <a href="https://log.perl.org/2021/01/perlcom-hijacked.html">Perl NOC blog post</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        Ever thought of contributing to Perl core?
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        I remember, during the peak of my contributions to CPAN, I came across a <a href="https://perlhacks.com/2017/06/i-wrote-some-perl/">blog post</a> by Dave Cross, sharing his first contribution to Perl core. As is always the case, I was so inspired by his work, so I decided to contribute as well. I found a small documentation patch to contribute. I followed the instructions about contributing to the Perl core as shared by Dave. Unfortunately, I never even received an acknowledgement. I doubt it ever made it into a release. I don't even have a record of my contribution. In short, my experience was not very nice. It kind of put me off, to be honest. The reason I am sharing this story is because I came across the latest <a href="https://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/2021/02/writing-perl-core-feature.html">blog post</a> by Leonerd which was on the same topic. It brought back my not-so-happy memory but I hope and wish it inspires more people to contribute to the Perl core.

        New to Perl? Do you want to find out about Perl's magic?
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        A fresh approach to showcasing the magic of Perl. It is always a pleasure to read about it. Above all, it is a very well-written <a href="https://dev.to/mjgardner/5-ways-you-can-embrace-the-magic-of-perl-1j11">blog post</a>. Highly recommended for tea-break reading. Don't forget to share it with newcomers to Perl.

        What is it that a developer hates the most?
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        I am not trying to make a sweeping statement. Believe it or not, TDD is the way forward. We all want to follow it as well but at times we find reasons to skip it. I am guilty of doing the same. But then when I come across this <a href="https://ovid.github.io/articles/managing-a-test-database.html">blog post</a> by Curtis, I feel ashamed of myself. In the post, he is not just talking about regular testing but he has gone one level up and is talking about having your own test database. What a novel idea. I am going to re-read one more time to make sure I don't miss any vital suggestions. English, not being my first language, there is always a chance that I miss something. Therefore I always read a blog post at least twice.

        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        How many of you have ever used StackOverflow to get an instant solution?
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        I doubt you come across many developers who don't know about StackOverflow. It is the best place to ask any tech-related questions. Many years ago, when I was working on my CPAN module <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Map-Tube">Map::Tube</a>, I got stuck and couldn't find the right solution. I went to StackOverflow for help and got a solution in no time. I was very impressed and decided to help others. I set up my account and started to keep an eye on Perl-related questions. I quickly found out there are many experienced members who know the rules inside-out that you are expected to follow when asking questions or giving answers. A colleague of mine in my office, an expert in Perl, tried his best to fit in but he gave up in the end unfortunately. What a loss to all of us as a community. My personal opinion is that it is not right place for someone new to the game with the attitude to help others. I may be wrong in my observation. Lets get back to the original point, I saw a post in the "Perl Programmers" Facebook group talking about <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66038573/why-does-the-package-qualification-of-symbols-result-in-less-memory-used-even-i/66039392#66039392">Why does the package qualification of symbols result in less memory used, even if the symbols are imported locally?</a>. I found Evan Carroll's response very in-depth and something that make me re-visit the basics. I remember a very famous line, "You learn something new every day".

        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        How many of you have seen the warning 'wide character in print' when running a Perl script?
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        I have seen this many times in the past, I must admit.  Dave Cross gave an exhaustive solution and explanation of the cause of this warning in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15210532/use-of-use-utf8-gives-me-wide-character-in-print">thread</a>. This has been my reference guide for years. The reason I am talking about it today is I came across a post <a href="https://dev.to/fgasper/perl-unicode-and-bytes-5cg7">Perl, Unicode, and Bytes</a> by Felipe Gasper. I wish I could explain the subject as well as he does in this blog post. This is definitely going to be my reference guide in the future

        Have you taken part in <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/">The Weekly Challenge - Perl & Raku</a> before?
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        If not, then this is the best time join the team and have fun. We are currently on <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-099">Week #99</a>. So, in theory, we will be celebrating the 100th week next Monday. I am hoping to break the record contributions of week #1. As of today, the record contributions stand at 155 (Perl, Raku and blogs) in the first week. It is within our reach to break the record with the support of 200+ members. Even if only 100 members just contribute to either Perl or Raku solutions to both the tasks, we can easily go past the 200 mark. Let us create history and be part of it.

                 I am a very late adopter, people have been doing this for a long time, but finally I also started it. I started streaming while I explore new things and write code. You can see the recordings and you can follow me on Twitch (and then you can set it up to send you alerts when I start streaming). I plan to stream frequently in two timeslots. Around 08:00 UTC and 18:00 UTC. I'd love to see you follow me and join me in some of the sessions.

                 A little background from a few days ago when I was still only thinking about starting to stream why I learn and explore new things and while I develop applications or contribute to Open Source projects. Since then I reached 30 followers on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/szabgab">Twitch</a>. Nice start.

                 Not all jobs are created equal. Sure, most pay the bills, but some do more. They impart a sense of purpose; when you log out at day’s end, it’s with the satisfaction that you are part of something bigger, something more important than yourself. You’ve left the world a little better than you found it, and isn’t that what life is really about?
