I have been using Mailman as the quick-and-dirty way to allow people to subscribe (and unsubscribe) and allow
me to send messages but from the beginning I wanted to use my own system.

There are several things I'd like to have. Mailman might have some of them but surely not all.

I'd like to address the e-mails to the individuals and not to the mailing list.

I'd also like to have some way to know how many people are actually reading the messages and
clicking on the links. The third-party mailing list services provide this feature by replacing
each link by a unique redirection link. They also embed a 1 pixel image in the HTML mail that
will allow the client to see how many user have even opened the mail. The latter won't work
in the text version but that's not critical.

Those are features I'd like to have but I don't want to outsource them to some third party
mailing list provider.
I'd like to see that my effort creating the newsletter really serves the subscribers
but I'd like to reduce the third parties collecting the same information.

There are several thing that need to be done:

<ol>
<li>Fetch list of users from Mailman. Can be done with [dist://WWW::Mailman]</li>
<li>Send e-mail directly to each person. Reduce the use of Mailman only for managing subscriptions.</li>
<li>Create a redirection script that will get a unique URL and redirect the user to the real URL logging the requests.</li>
<li>When generating the e-mail messages replace the real links with unique links pointing to the redirector.</li>
<li>Create subscription management in Dancer that allows the setting HTML/Text.</li>
<li>Move the whole system to a real Dancer application.</li>
</ul>

Maybe this?
