      "I noticed several familiar names from the recently concluded <strong>PTS 2025</strong>, including <strong>Salve J. Nilsen</strong>, <strong>Ference Erki</strong> and <strong>Julien Fiegehenn</strong>. There are also regular attendees like <strong>Mark Overmeer</strong>, <strong>Nicholas Clark</strong>, <strong>Max Maischein</strong>, <strong>Lee Johnson</strong>, <strong>Renee Backer</strong> and <strong>Soren Laird Sorries</strong>. However, one notable absence is <strong>Thomas Klausner</strong>.",
      "Looking at the schedule, it's shaping up to be a highly impactful event. And yes, <strong>R Geoffrey Avery</strong>, the Gong man, is also listed as the <strong>Lightning Talks</strong> manager.",
      "As many of you know the <strong>PTS 2025</strong>, wrapped up just a week ago and we've already seen plenty of event reports from the participants.",
      "This was my first time attending the <strong>Perl Toolchain Summit</strong>, and I'm grateful to the organisers for the opportunity. While I've been to many <strong>Perl Conferences</strong>, <strong>PTS</strong> was a completely difference experience altogether. The setting allowed for more frequent interaction with attendees, making it easier to seek (and receive) instant help. The knowledge sharing was at its peak, especially with people like <strong>Paul Evans</strong> in the room. Some participants like <strong>Neil Bowers</strong> and <strong>Leo Lapworth</strong> joined remotely via video conference.",
      "I wasn't fully prepared as my invitation came at the last minute. In contrast, most attendees had everything well planned. I observed structured groups focusing on specific tasks e.g. <strong>MetaCPAN</strong>, <strong>CPAN Security</strong>, <strong>CPAN Testers</strong>, <strong>PAUSE</strong>. I was free to join any. I chose <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> both because it's close to my heart and because of <strong>Olaf Alders</strong>.",
      "Admittedly, I didn't have my laptop set up for contributions initially. But thanks to the <strong>PTS</strong> environment, I had a working local <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> web instance, in no time.
