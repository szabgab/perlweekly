      "I am not sure, if you noticed this but <a href=\"https://perlmonks.org/\">PerlMonks</a> certificate expired few days ago. I only noticed as one of the contributor to <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a> shared link to the site. The very next day, I saw post by <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> on Twitter talking about it and sharing the <a href=\"https://www.prettygoodping.com\">tool</a> that can help avoid such incident in future. The certificate has now been restored.",

      "I saw <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity/permalink/1538251906982430\">Facebook post</a> by <strong>Mark Keating</strong> just few days ago. I remember, <strong>Doug Bell</strong> helped many years ago when I was playing daily <strong>CPAN</strong> upload games. He gave me access to deal with the issues I was facing at the time. I just hope, it stays live and kicking. It is the second best thing for us after <strong>MetaCPAN</strong>. If you are interested to sponsor the <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> then you now have plenty of different options. Please find out more about it in the <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/metacpan-core\">official announcement</a> page.",
