As per the tradition, we have a public repository where anyone can share ideas and comments: <a href=\"https://github.com/metacpan/perl-assets\">perl-assets</a>. There is even a public channel, <a href=\"https://app.slack.com/client/T2VEZKFPG/C05KBHFH1AA\">#perl-logo</a> under the <strong>perlfoundation</strong> slack workspace where you can discuss the subject with others. The <a href=\"https://www.perl.org\">perl.org</a> site has already adopted the new logo. It is also used in the <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org\">Perldoc</a> website. <strong>OpenCage</strong> also used the new logo in the <a href=\"https://opencagedata.com/tutorials\">tutorials section</a>.",
