      "The term \"Elevator Pitch Day\" was coined by one of the respected members of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers\">Facebook Perl Programmers</a> group. I like the idea behind it as described in the post. The core idea is to invite members to organise a virtual meet-up to discuss all those awesome startup idea out there. It would be nice to find out who we can get to attend that has money/connections/resources to try and make it happen. Would you be interested in joining us? I am definitely up for it.",
