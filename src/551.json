So I read the <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/\">Outreachy Applicant Guide</a>. They explain that one needs to show why they should be accepted and they recommend this to be detailed. So instead of writing \"I face religious discrimination\" they suggest the applicant writes \"I am a Muslim in France. Muslims make up less than 2.3% of France's population. I face religious discrimination.\". So people at Outreachy think that Muslims in France face religious discrimination AND/OR they try to encourage people to feel that way.

      "Two weeks ago I wrote about Wordle and that it has 'Nothing to do with Perl'. Within a few hours Saif Ahmed proved me wrong and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/siuqy9/nothing_to_do_with_perl/\">posted</a> an implementation of Wordle in Perl. That's the spirit!",
      "On a totally different topic, but still nothing to do with Perl: I just saw someone I know from the Perl community posting yet another disgusting accusation against Israel. As people more clever than me said: 'In the Middle Ages, Jews were accused of killing Christ. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century they were accused of ruining the nations where they lived. Today they are accused of apartheid, genocide, and having concentration camps'. Some people always find ways to blame the Jews for the crimes that are considered the worst by the contemporary civilization. Why am I writing about this, you ask? Because it hurts me a lot. You can't do much about it, but I hope that whenever you hear or see something horrific thing that Israel is accused of, you will double and triple-check it before you accept it as truth, 'like' it, or 'share' it. I hope you'll remember that an awful lot of misinformation is spread by people. Both by people who have an agenda against Jews and people who fall for true-looking lies.",
