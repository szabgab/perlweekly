      "Hi there!",
      "Last week Mohammad raised the idea of a GitHub-pages-based central blogging platform for Perl to which Dave Cross added his <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/vwb2j1/perl_weekly_issue_572_perl_blogger/\">comment</a> pointing out a misunderstanding. At first I liked the idea of Mohammad as way of making it easier for people who don't know how to setup a blog, but on a second thought. Setting up a site for blogging on GitHub pages is less than 5 minutes. On GitLab and Codeberg it might take a bit more, but still way less than the whole writing part. If you need help ask Flavio, David, Mohammad, or myself.",
      "A few years ago the Perl community got really enthusiastic by the idea of supporting each other via one of the monthly-support platforms. The problem, as I understood, was, that most people received only some small pocket money that did not make any real impact. So most people thought: Instead of taking home 20-40 USD a month I will use this money to support others. We ended up with a circular support in which no one received any substantial support. If you go over the amounts the <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/supporting-perl-creators\">Perl related people</a> receive you'll see that most of them only receive a few 10s of USD. For most people living in the economically advanced world that's just pocket money. Manwar is the person closest to some substantial amount, but he still needs more.",
      "This is our challenge now. Can we, as a community, increase his support to reach 500 UK pound? We are already half-way there. If you already support him, please consider increasing the amount so we reach USD 10/supporter! (we are at about USD 5.5). If you are not supporting him yet, do it now:  <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/manwar/\">Manwar</a>",
