      "Hi there",
      "How much have you contributed during the Hacktoberfest event yet?",
      "CPAN needs helping hand not just during the Hacktoberfest time only. I am raising the subject as Dave Cross recently blogged about his experience with one of the distribution hosted on CPAN in this <a href=\"https://dev.to/davorg/failing-to-get-product-information-from-amazon-with-perl-5a3g\">blog</a>. It also reminds me of my early days when I created Perl library to some of the Google public API. Of all, two of them, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/WWW-Google-CustomSearch\">WWW::Google::CustomSearch</a> and <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/WWW-Google-Places\">WWW::Google::Places</a>, used by many as I have had many queries related to them in the past. It is very common for API provider to discontinue the service or move to new direction any time without notice. It becomes even a bigger issue if the author of the distribution disappears from the scene. So the question, how best to deal with such cases. Thanks to the PAUSE admins, there is a documented process to adopt a distribution and take it forward. You should get in touch with one of the PAUSE admins if you want to adopt a distribution and contribute.",
      "For many years, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/recent\">MetaCPAN</a> had been my playground. I used to spend 2-4 hours every day looking for low-hanging issues in the recently uploaded distributions. I even wrote 2-parts blog talking about how to become CPAN contributor? <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor\">Part 1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor-part-2\">Part 2</a>. I even gave a talk at The Perl Conference in Glasgow 2018 on the same topic. You can watch the talk on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYN1nijo9VY\">YouTube</a>, if you fancy.",
      "I remember at one point, I was keen to contribute to MetaCPAN and be part of the Toolchain Gang. I couldn't get the local dev setup of MetaCPAN and was looking for help. I was told that someone from the gang is working on dockerization of MetaCPAN to make it easier for anyone to contribute. I missed the opportunity to meet the gang when it was held in Marlow, not far from where I live (London) in 2019. I don't know if anyone is still working on that front.",
      "I hardly contribute to CPAN these days but I still like to call myself CPAN contributor. However I do release patch every now and then to some of my personal distributions and also adopted distributions. Being a member of <a href=\"https://pullrequest.club/hello\">Pull Request Club</a>, I do contribute to at least one distribution every month. I have never missed a month since I joined the club in Jan 2019.",
