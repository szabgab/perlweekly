      "Personally, I am not. Reason, I still struggle to get my head around it. During my early days of learning, I never got the opportunity to work with Unicode. So far, I never had to extensively deal with Unicode characters. There is so much information available on internet. I remember, long time ago, I was dealing with well known warning <strong>Wide character in print</strong>. After a quick search, I came across this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15210532/use-of-use-utf8-gives-me-wide-character-in-print\">thread</a> by <strong>Dave Cross</strong>. I have kept it bookmark for future reference. I am repeating myself as I remember talking about in the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/498.html\">weekly newsletter</a> earlier. It is worth sharing with the readers again and again.",
      "However, there is another reason why I am talking about it today. Let me share gem of an <a href=\"https://dev.to/drhyde/a-brief-guide-to-perl-character-encoding-if7\">article</a> by <strong>David Cantrell</strong>. The article gives us inside out knowledge about Unicode, specially for a Perl developer. It has cleared most of my doubts, so a big thanks to <strong>David</strong> for such a great article. It also introduced me to a new word, <strong>Mojibake</strong>. A friend of mine on Facebook, suggested a CPAN module, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Mojibake\">Test::Mojibake</a> which is very handy. I wish there was dedicated book on Perl and Unicode. Having said, I found this <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Perl_Programming/Unicode_UTF-8\">Wikibook</a> on the subject, you may want to explore.",
      "I came across <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4\">YouTube video</a> that explains the Unicode in general that any layman can easily understand as well. I loved it the way it is explain in a casual way. The guy in the video makes it so simple.",
      "Let's talk about regex in Perl.",
      "I am sure you have used regex in Perl at some point in your career. Few days ago, I found out a clever piece of regex shared by Abigail. The use of //g in list context. It completely blown me away. Later someone pointed me to the official Perl <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre#Repeated-Patterns-Matching-a-Zero-length-Substring\">documentation</a> talking about it. If you are curious to know more about it then I would suggest you please take a look at his <a href=\"https://abigail.github.io/HTML/Perl-Weekly-Challenge/week-150-1.html\">blog post</a>.",
      "Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
