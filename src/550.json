      "Hi there",
      "Are you a Unicode fan?",
      "Personally, I am not. The reason is that I still struggle to get my head around it. During my early days of learning, I never got the opportunity to work with Unicode. So far, I have never had to deal extensively with Unicode characters. There is so much information available on the internet. I remember, a long time ago, I was dealing with the well-known warning <strong>Wide character in print</strong>. After a quick search, I came across this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15210532/use-of-use-utf8-gives-me-wide-character-in-print\">explanation</a> by <strong>Dave Cross</strong>. I have kept it bookmark for future reference. I know am repeating myself here as I remember talking about in an <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/498.html\">earlier weekly newsletter</a>. It is worth sharing with readers again and again.",
      "However, there is another reason why I am talking about it today. Let me share gem of an <a href=\"https://dev.to/drhyde/a-brief-guide-to-perl-character-encoding-if7\">article</a> by <strong>David Cantrell</strong>. The article gives us very deeps knowledge about Unicode, specially for a Perl developer. It has cleared most of my doubts, so a big thanks to <strong>David</strong> for such a great article. It also introduced me to a new word, <strong>Mojibake</strong>. A friend of mine on Facebook, suggested a CPAN module, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Mojibake\">Test::Mojibake</a> which is very handy. I wish there was dedicated book on Perl and Unicode. Having said that, I found this <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Perl_Programming/Unicode_UTF-8\">Wikibook</a> on the subject, you may want to explore it.",
      "I came across a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4\">YouTube video</a> that explains Unicode in terms that any lay-person can easily understand. I loved it the way it is explained in a casual way. The guy in the video makes it so simple.",
      "Let's talk about regexes in Perl.",
      "I am sure you have used regexes in Perl at some point in your career. A few days ago, I found out a clever use of regexes shared by Abigail. The use of //g in list context. It completely blew me away. Later someone pointed me to the official Perl <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre#Repeated-Patterns-Matching-a-Zero-length-Substring\">documentation</a> talking about it. If you are curious to know more about it then I would suggest you take a look at his <a href=\"https://abigail.github.io/HTML/Perl-Weekly-Challenge/week-150-1.html\">blog post</a>.",
