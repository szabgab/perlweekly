      "Hi there",
      "The headline of this week's newsletter is dedicated to all my German friends. However, the message is global \"Good bye Hacktoberfest\". I don't know the language, so I asked Google to help me. I am sure you all celebrated the month-long festival with loads of contributions to many opensource codebases. I can completely understand the feeling at the end of the month. Those who have participated and completed the challenge successfully i.e. submitted at least 4 eligible Pull Requests, should just relax and wait for their FREE gift. Please take November as a break as December will bring in another fun challenge i.e. <a href=\"https://24pullrequests.com\">24 Pull Requests</a> for you.",
      "Anything else to look forward to?",
      "For me, there is another fun bit is the \"Advent Calendar\". There will be plenty of Advent Calendars available during the month. It is really hard to follow all of them. I came across something called, <a href=\"http://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet\">Advent Planet</a>, which collects almost all popular Advent Calendars for us. Please do check it out, if you want a early peek. I really miss those days when I used to have time for such things. I have contributed to the Perl/Raku advent calendars in the past. If you have spare time and interest then please do get in touch with the person behind the project now and book your slot. There is one <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2020\">Advent Calendar</a> dedicated to the members of <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a> only. I make sure the tradition continues every year. I hope everything goes as per the plan and we have another fun Advent Calendar by the dedicated members this year.",
      "Start your week with yet another informative newsletter. You take care of yourself and your family. Keep a safe distance and stay safe,"
