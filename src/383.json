      "Hi there!",
      "During the last two weeks there was a little storm in the teacup.",
      "It started with an article about CGI.pm on perl.com that struck the nerves of Dave Cross and a few other people who seem to be against the use of CGI.pm and CGI in general. The others came pointing out the value in the simplicity of CGI and the fact that CGI.pm comes (or rather just came) with standard Perl that eliminates (eliminated) the need for installations. I personally think that is totally ok to write small things as CGI if that's the only thing you know and/or the environment has limitations. I also think it was a mistake to remove CGI.pm from core, but who asks me :)",
      "Off Topic: I've started to learn Spanish. First via <a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\">Duolingo</a> and by finding content on the web. A few days ago I had the first live lesson via <a href=\"https://www.italki.com/i/EFbbfc?hl=en_us\">Italki</a>. I enjoyed it very much. (In case you'd like to try it, that link is an affiliate link that will give both of us some credit.)",
