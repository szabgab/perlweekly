     "as you can surely tell, there have been some changes in the Perl Weekly. First of all let me welcome Neil Bowers, the newest addition to the Perl Weekly editors. I am sure it will be a lot of fun for him and for you, the reader who will see different styles of editing. This time in British English. I hope my spell-checker won't 'fix' his words.",
     "In order to make it easier to distinguish who is the editor, the From address is now set to the current editor, and you will also see a small avatars of the person to the right of this text. Somewhere there =>",
     "In addition we started to include little avatars of the authors. I hope this will make the whole newsletter more personal. We can't always find a real picture of the person, but we'll try. If you see an article without an image, and you can help finding one (80x80), please send it to us.",
     "Lastly, for today, if you would like to submit an article or want to send a comment to <b>all</b> the editors, please send it to the new editors@perlweekly.com address.",
