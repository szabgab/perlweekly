      "Hi there",
      "A few months ago, Gabor Szabo, raised a concern that not many people blog about Perl and its smart features. I have noticed that there is an improvement in the recent weeks. The Perl Weekly Challenge always encouraged its member to blog about their solutions. It is not just limited to Perl Weekly Challenge, I have also noticed Olaf Olders blogged about his experience of creating <a href=\"http://www.olafalders.com/2019/05/23/creating-a-twitter-list-of-cpan-authors/\">Twitter list of CPAN Authors</a>. Similary, Damian Conway, blogged <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/05/why-i-love-perl-6.html\">Why I love Perl6</a>. And how can I miss, this blog, <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/articles/alan-kay-and-oo-programming.html\">Alan Kay and OO Programming</a>, by Curtis \"Ovid\" Poe, which started big dicussion on OO. I am sure there are plenty out there that I am not aware of. Please do share your blog with us if you have written one.",
      "I found Twitter very helpful in spreading the word, I came across many such blogs (mentioned above) through my Twitter handle. I suggest we should have dedicated Twitter handle for all such technical blogs. In my humble opinion, you get to learn a lot about the subject by reading technical blog than any books. In technical blog, the author has the liberty to go into finer details and not worry about the size of the content.",
