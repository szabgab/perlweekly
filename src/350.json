      "A fortnight ago Timm Murray and Steve Bertrand, two long time Perl developers, have started to write an eBook and started a crowdfunding campaign to gauge interest and to support their work. Their fund-raising goal is very modest only $2,5000, but if the campaign reached $4,000 they will add some extra chapters. In the first 2 weeks they raised $1,361 by 55 backers (54%). Let's show them the Perl Weekly readers are interested in their book and are ready to give them some coins to support the range of Perl-related books. Let's help them reach their goal! <a href=\"https://igg.me/at/ljtfKylacQ0/x/775728\">Support the campaign now!</a>",
