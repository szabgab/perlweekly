      "It is no longer a secret that I am the biggest fan of the <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki\">Corinna</a> project, headed by Curtis Poe. The motto of the project tells you everything you need to know about it, \"Good enough\" is not good enough. Having said that we still have to wait for the final push by the team behind the project.",

      "Well, we are encouraged to give <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Pad\">Object::Pad</a> a try. Paul Evans is the man behind this distribution. A fellow member of Team PWC, Cheok-Yin Fung, wrote a blog post, <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/c_y_fung/2020/09/oo-linked-lists-in-perl.html\">OO linked lists in Perl</a>, last year (25th Sep 2020 to be precise). She updated this blog post recently and added another implementation using Object::Pad. This is what I call serious hacking. I have one more similar story to share with you as shared in a <a href=\"https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/08/03/whats-next-oo-perl/\">blog post</a> by Mark Gardner. In this post, Mark shared his experience dealing with Object::Pad. With so much going on about Object::Pad, I gave myself a week to get things in place. But the week went past without any results unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, I am not giving up yet. I will get my hands dirty and share my experience with everyone. In fact, Dave Cross, suggested I should include Object::Pad in the book I am currently working on. Currently the book has solutions implemented in traditional OO and Moo only. I will definitely add Object::Pad in the second revision soon after, promise.",
      "Do you have any stories to share with regard to Object::Pad? If yes then please do share them with us. Or if you haven't tried it then why not give it a go and make-over your existing project to use Object::Pad.",
      "Last but not least, did you attend <a href=\"https://conf.raku.org/\">The Raku Conference</a>? If not then you can still watch the recordings of the three-day event. I also gave a short talk (30 minutes) on day three about \"Making of Raku Developer\".",
