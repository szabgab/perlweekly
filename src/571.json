      "What if you had a steady income of a few thousand USDs just for doing awesome things for Perl so you can afford to do whatever you want? I bet there would be tons of things you could do. Improving CPAN modules, patching Perl, writing articles, recording videos, encouraging others to write more. etc.",
      "So what if we could support a few people to do just that? How could you be part of it? You could <a href=\"https://perlfoundation.org/donate\">donate to TPF</a>, but for you, as an individual it might be better to support an individual directly. Without the organizational overhead. For this a while ago I put together the list of <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/supporting-perl-creators\">all the Perl-related people</a>, I knew about at that time, who are accepting donations. They are mostly looking for monthly support instead of a one-time support. In my opinion it is much better to support someone with $10/month than $200 one-time donation. Partially because having a steady income is much better than having the need to raise more funds every few weeks or even every few months. With that said both at Patreon and GitHub Sponsors you can subscribe to a regular donation and then, after the payment you can cancel it. Effectively providing a one-time donation.",
      "I went over the list now. There are 11 people listed on that page with a total of 139 sponsors. (There is probably some overlap the same person sponsoring more than one 'creator'.)",
      "Personally I'd recommend you <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/manwar\">sponsor the work of Mohammad</a> as he both creates code and generates a lot of publicity for Perl, but if you decide to support someone else from the list that's awesome too. If you find donate to someone who is not in this list yet, and if they agree, feel free to send a PR to add them to the list.",
