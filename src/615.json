      "The <a href=\"https://perltoolchainsummit.org/pts2023/\">Perl Toolchain Summit</a> was held last week in Lyon, France. The website itself does not have a lot of information on it, but luckily the participants have blogged about it. There is plenty for you to read now if you'd like to keep up with the development in Perl, how to package Perl modules; how to install them, how CPAN and MetaCPAN work etc.",
      "The PTS is a small even for people who are very deeply involved in the Perl ecosystem. It is a brain-storming session and a Hackathon. I wish there were similar session held more frequently around the world.",
      "If you are looking for some Perl related event to participate in, there are two that I know of listed at the bottom of the newsletter and on our <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/events.html\">events page</a>. One is the <a href=\"https://tprc2023.sched.com/\">The Perl and Raku Conference in July in Toronto, Canada</a> and the other one is the <a href=\"https://perlkohacon.fi/\">Perl and Koha conference</a> in August in Helsinki, Finland.",
