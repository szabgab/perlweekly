Most notably was <a href=\"http://www.perladvent.org/2019/\">Perl</a> and <a href=\"https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2019/12/\">Raku</a>. The best of all was the one by <a href=\"https://andrewshitov.com/category/advent-calendar-2019/\">Andrew Shitov</a>, where we were introduced to a new language each day.",

      "If not then why not give it a try. For me it is like getting your name in the history book forever. Last year, I contributed to Raku Advent Calendar for the first time. Before that, I even had the pleasure to be part of Perl Advent Calendar. The best part of any Advent Calendar is the surprise element. Every day brings a new fun subject to explore.",
      "My pet project <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge<a/> also created the first <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2019/\">Advent Calendar</a> last year. I haven't had the time to plan this year Advent Calendar. Having said, I am going to do my best not to disappoint fan of The Weekly Challenge.",
      "Is that all for for us in the month of December?",
      "Well, no. There is another fun challenge for those who enjoy contributing opensource codebase and it is called <a href=\"https://24pullrequests.com/\">24 Pull Requests</a>. I haven't had good time contributing in the year 2019 for many reasons as compare to my past records. Having said, I would be taking part again this year and complete the challenge without fail.",
