      "It is time to get ready for 2020's Advent Calendars. Last year's Advent was the best so far as there was a flood of Advent Calendars. Most notable were the <a href=\"http://www.perladvent.org/2019/\">Perl</a> and <a href=\"https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2019/12/\">Raku</a> Advent Calendars. The best of all was the one by <a href=\"https://andrewshitov.com/category/advent-calendar-2019/\">Andrew Shitov</a>, where we were introduced to a new language every day.",
      "So what do I expect in the COVID-19 year, 2020?",
      "Well, first of all, I would like to have the Advent Calendar for Dancer2 back. I missed it dearly last year. Dancer2 is very close to my heart. I had the honour to be part of this Advent Calendar once in the past. Whoever is responsible this year, please don't let us down this time.",
      "Have you contributed to Perl/Raku Advent Calendar?",
      "If not, then why not give it a try? For me it is like getting your name in the history books forever. Last year, I contributed to the Raku Advent Calendar for the first time. Before that, I had the pleasure to be part of the Perl Advent Calendar. The best part of any Advent Calendar is the element of surprise. Every day brings a new fun subject to explore.",
      "My pet project <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge<a/> also created its first <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2019/\">Advent Calendar</a> last year. I haven't had the time to plan this year's Advent Calendar. But, having said that, I will do my best to not disappoint fans of The Weekly Challenge.",
      "Is that all for us in the month of December?",
      "Well, no. There is another fun challenge for those who enjoy contributing to open source codebases and it is called <a href=\"https://24pullrequests.com/\">24 Pull Requests</a>. I haven't had as good a time contributing in the year 2019 compared to my past records, for many reasons. Having said that, I will be taking part again this year and hope to complete the challenge without fail.",
      "We would love to know your plans with regard to Advent Calendars or 24 Pull Requests. Please do share your story with us. Last, but not least, please do take care of yourself and your family. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter."
