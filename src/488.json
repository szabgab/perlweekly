      "Hi there",
      "It is time to get ready for Advent Calendar 2020. Last year Advent Calendar was the best so far as there was a flood of Advent Calendars. Most notably was <a href=\"http://www.perladvent.org/2019/\">Perl</a> and <a href=\"https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2019/12/\">Raku</a>. The best of all was the one by <a href=\"https://andrewshitov.com/category/advent-calendar-2019/\">Andrew Shitov</a>, where we were introduced to a new language each day.",
      "So what do I expect in the COVID-19 year 2020?",
      "Well, first of all, I would like to have Advent Calendar for Dancer2 back. I missed it dearly last year. Dancer2 is very close to my heart. I had the honour to be part of Advent Calendar in the past once. Whoever is responsible this year, please don't let us down this time.",
      "Have you contributed to Perl/Raku Advent Calendar?",
      "If not then why not give it a try. For me it is like getting your name in the history book forever. Last year, I contributed to Raku Advent Calendar for the first time. Before that, I even had the pleasure to be part of Perl Advent Calendar. The best part of any Advent Calendar is the surprise element. Every day brings a new fun subject to explore.",
      "My pet project <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge<a/> also created the first <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2019/\">Advent Calendar</a> last year. I haven't had the time to plan this year Advent Calendar. Having said, I am going to do my best not to disappoint fan of The Weekly Challenge.",
      "Is that all for for us in the month of December?",
      "Well, no. There is another fun challenge for those who enjoy contributing opensource codebase and it is called <a href=\"https://24pullrequests.com/\">24 Pull Requests</a>. I haven't had good time contributing in the year 2019 for many reasons as compare to my past records. Having said, I would be taking part again this year and complete the challenge without fail.",
      "We would love to know your plan with regard to Advent Calendar or 24 Pull Request. Please do share your story with us. Last but not the least, please do take care of yourself and your family. Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
