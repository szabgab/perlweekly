First of all, of course the fact that they sponsor some Perl-related activity. They also blog about it. They also send us a heads up to be included here in the Perl Weekly. I hope many more small and large companies, and also individuals will follow them.",

Buying a T-shirt or some other swag will both help you with clothing and help TPF financially. Nice initiative!",

It would be awesome to get a few of you start supporting me via GitHub in the next couple of days. That will help things get rolling there and I would be able to see how the system really works.",
