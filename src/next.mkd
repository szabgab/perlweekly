# It's YAPC::NA Time!
June 3, 2013

As you are reading this, a vast contingent of the Perl community, including
PerlWeekly's very own overlord (hi Gabor!), will already have undergone their
yearly migration to the North American edition of YAPC. From Monday to
Wednesday, a teeming mass of perl hackers will haunt the streets of 
sunny Austin, Texas. Wish you were there? Then do the next best things: lurk
in the #yapc channel of perl.irc.org, and watch the conference website for
announcements of live streaming.

a place listing all companies using Perl. And now, tadah, say 'hi!' to the
Perl Companies project.

David Golden proposed earlier this month to move Module::Build out of Perl 5 core.
He explains here his rationale, and provides a comprehensive overview of 
what Module::Build managed to achieve (which is a lot), and what weaknesses
proved to be its Achilles's heels.

'ack', 'cpanm', 'local::lib', 'perlbrew'. Four tools that do one thing, and do
it exceedingly well. Jeffrey Kegler muses for a few instants on their
streamlined design, and discusses on how they can be taken as examples of
exquisitely effective interfaces.

### Using Perl in the Real World (Cookbook)
http://blogs.perl.org/users/rlauer/2013/05/using-perl-in-the-real-world-cookbook.html
2013-05-29

rlauer laments the lack of Perl one-stop cookbook focusing on interacting with the big
applications -- Google Docs, Flickr, Amazon, etc -- out there, and wonders if
a wiki or a collaborative venture shouldn't be organized to fill that void.

### How I manage new perls with perlbrew
http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/2134/how-i-manage-new-perls-with-perlbrew/
2013-05-20

Perl 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16, 5.18, and all their patch versions... There sure are a lot of perls out there. Even
more if you play with the development versions. But thanks to perlbrew and
cpanm, compiling a wide selection of them is fairly easy. David Golden walks
us through the handful of scripts and tricks he uses to make managing the herd even
easier.


### given & smartmatch in Perl 5.18

2013-05-30

So the smartmatch has been sort of deprecated in perl 5.18. Turns out that 
the official documentation showing how to silence its warnings has a small
error. domm shows us the corrected version (alongside some legit and sane uses
of smartmatch).

homogenous type management throughout the Moo / Moose / Mouse ecosystem.
