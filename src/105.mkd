# Summertime and the hackin's easy
July 29, 2013

Another quiet summer week. This week, for your pleasure, we have OSCON
slidedecks and videos, survey results from YAPC::NA (and discussions on what
they mean), Git tools, new dependency managing tricks and a few good articles giving tips and pointers on how to contribute 
to CPAN and the community. ... so yeah, it was a quiet but quite active week, after
all. In any case, enjoy! ~Yanick
