      "If you are active on social platform then you must have seen the recent blog by Dave Cross titled, <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2020/09/blogging-for-perl/\">Blogging for Perl</a>. Do you agree with him? Personally I agree with him. I followed the initial work sponsored by TPF to improve the official Perl blogging site. I agree with Dave about blogging in places where you have visitors from other languages and share the power of the Perl language. Having said that I would say, why not have our own dedicated blogging hub. They both can co-exists, imho. I want it to become the source of Perl wisdoms. I would be sad if blogs.perl.org is no longer loved by the community. Dave Cross, followed up with another blog, <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2020/09/down-the-rabbit-hole/\">Down the rabbit hole</a> talking about his proposed aggregator for Perl blogs, <a href=\"http://perl.theplanetarium.org/\">Planet Perl</a>. Please check it out and share your views.",
      "I know many members of Perl community who have taken the difficult path of blogging about Perl power on a daily basis. For example, John Scoles, did a series on <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/byterock/\">PAWS</a>. Currently, Flavio Poletti, has been doing daily round up, <a href=\"https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY/\">here</a>",
      "The <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/p5-reviews/\">Team PWC</a> is not behind either, they have been sharing the power of Perl every week.",
      "last but not the least, you take care of yourself and your family. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter."
