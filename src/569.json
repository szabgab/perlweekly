      "Hi,",
      "4 weeks ago I <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/565.html\">asked you to support the Perl Weekly</a>. It got very little response. Then 2 weeks ago I wrote <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/567.html\">how disappointed I am</a>. Wow, the abuse I received for that. Both on Reddit an in private emails.",
      "The funny thing is that the people who got upset that I asked for people to show their support are mostly the ones who never did anything for Perl.",
      "However, the really imporant thing is that within 24 hours some 20 additional people started to support Mohammad and today we are already at 50 supporters! I was very impressed. Thank you!",
      "<b>Thank you!</b>",
      "In any case, think about this as a fund-raiser for Perl. For many years I hardly saw any fund-raising effort by TPF. This week, to my great surprise they put out a prospectus calling for support. I hope they have the communication channels to spread the information about it and will do the legwork that is need to get the support of the community.",
      "For some strange reason they still mix Perl and Raku. Frankly I think it would be much better to both Perl and Raku if they stopped this mix and the two names/languages/dialects, whatever you call them, went separate ways.",
      "Anyway, if you are interested to financially support the Perl activists, you now have a choice: <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/new-prospectus-launched-june-22\">TPF</a>, directly <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/manwar/\">Mohammand S.
