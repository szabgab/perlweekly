      "I first came to know about <strong>LAMP</strong> in the year <strong>1999</strong> when I was first introduced to <strong>Perl</strong>. Although the term was first coined by <strong>Michael Kunze</strong> in the year <strong>1998</strong>. During that time, <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong> were the only two contenders. Many years later, <strong>Python</strong> joined the gang. That makes it good fun discussion on what <strong>P</strong> stands for in <strong>LAMP</strong>. Those days, Web Development was mostly around <strong>Perl</strong> and good old friend <strong>CGI</strong>. Things have changed for good in all these years. We now have plenty of choices to pick from, like <strong>Catalyst</strong>, <strong>Mojolicious</strong>, <strong>Dancer2</strong> etc etc. Most of my time with <strong>Perl</strong> spent on Web Development. At one place, we had inhouse Web Framework, which worked like a charm but recently when I moved to <a href=\"https://www.oleeo.com\">Oleeo</a>, I got the opportunity to work with <strong>Catalyst</strong>. I am a big fan of <strong>Dancer2</strong>, so getting on with <strong>Catalyst</strong> was a little difficult. Having said, I did find some similarities between the two.",
      "Going back to the topic, <strong>LAMP</strong>, I remember a <a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/lamp-is-dead-long-live-perl-web-frameworks\">blog post</a> on the same subject going into fine details and variations. It was fun read.",
      "I also came across this question, <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/736203/why-perl-is-included-into-lamp-server\">Why Perl is included into lamp-server?</a>. I loved the reply to the question. I never thought about it before.
