      "Recently I came across <a href=\"https://www.activestate.com/blog/getting-ready-for-perl-7/\">blog post</a> talking about preparation to Migrate to Perl 7. It is always nice to see ActiveState is showing interest. ActiveState has been the in the forefront when it comes to Perl on Windows imho. I have always kept a copy of ActiveState Perl on my windows box, just in case. Not many books available on Perl 7 except one, <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/preparing_for_perl7\">Preparing for Perl 7</a> by brian d foy. It is the best introduction to Perl 7.",

Although he doesn't blog very often these days but everytime he does I make sure I don't miss it. There is always something for everyone.",

He recently shared a blog <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/ferki\">looking for sponsor</a>. Do you use Rex? If you do then please do become the first sponsor.",
