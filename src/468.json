      "Hi there",
      "If you ask me this question today, then my short answer would be \"Yes\". I give credit to every member of the team working on the project. Curtis being one of them who does all the talk. If you follow the usual public platform like Facebook, Twitter and blogs.perl.org then you would see the regular updates from him. It is always nice to that it is making steady progress. Above all, it is making positive noise. My personal opinion is that Cor has been accepted by the wider Perl community based on what I read so far by various high profile members of the Perl community.",
      "There is another news that caught my eyes last week, was an honest attempt by TPF and the marketing team headed by Mark Keating to make Perl #1 again. We as a community need to help the team to achieve the target. I was approached by the team and I humbly accepted to be a part of it. As of now, I don't know how I am going to help the cause. Hopefully in the coming weeks, the marketing team would make the plan crystal clear.",
      "On a side note, this is my 56th edition of the newsletter. With this, I have now gone past Neil Bowers (55 issues). The only editor who has done more than me is now Yanick Champoux (63 issues). It would take another 4 months to go past him and becomes the second in line after the chief editor Gabor Szabo (264 issues).",
      "Last but not the least, you take care of yourself and your family. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter."
