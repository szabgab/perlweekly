     "<strong>YAPC::Fukuoka 2025</strong> is happening on 14-15 Nov 2025.",
     "I'm also excited about <strong>LPW 2025</strong>. From our latest update from the organisers, the event is moving forward. They're making every effort to ensure it happens, which is no small feat given the short notice. What's particularly remarkable is that they're managing this with just a two-person team.",
     "They truly need our support, so please do reach out if you can help. The organisers are currently seeking sponsors, volunteers and speakers. I've tentatively submitted a talk proposal myself.",
     "Hopefully, I'll see you all at the event. The venue is expected to be confirmed this week. For the latest updates, please check the <a href=\"https://londonperlworkshop.com\">website</a>.",
     "Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
