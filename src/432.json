      "I find Hacktoberfest very addictive. How about you? This year event just concluded. I noticed lots of noise during the month to new and regulars to join the event. People like brain d foy, even published an exclusive <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/hacktoberfest-2019/\">blog</a> to encourage and share new ideas for the event. Not sure if there is a way to figure out how individuals or groups contributed to Open Source during the event. I am specially interested how much Perl and Raku community involved. For the first time, Team Perl Weekly Challenge, took part in the Hacktoberfest event and did a great job, imho. Together they submitted 165 Pull Requests.",
      "Personally for me as well, it was the best year ever where I contributed 160 Pull Requests. I am sure there are plenty of others who played their part. If you did take part then please do share your experience with us. It would definitely help others to learn from your experience.",
