      "Recently I wrote quite a few posts about dealing with legacy Perl code in corporations. One of the key things is the need to write automated tests and to set up a CI system. The Perl community was really good at writing tests for the CPAN modules and making it easy to write test. The Perl community (or members of it) even created the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers</a> a sort of slow CI system that was one of the best such systems in the early 2000s.",
      "However when I look at the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html\">stats</a> I've been  collecting it seems that only 50% of recently uploaded CPAN modules have any form of CI system configured. (Actually maybe I should look at the cup half full and celebrate that 50% already have CI? I don't have numbers about other programming language communities.) I keep hoping that more people will embrace the idea. I even recorded a video explaining the new CI system I set up for Test::Class.",
