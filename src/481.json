      "Hi,",
      "for many years I was hoping to be able to work remotely - or to make it sound even better - in a distributed work environment, but I have not done much to advance it. Now the pandemic forced my clients to keep everyone at home and thus I, as consultant/contractor can also work from home. Some other clients where I provide training have also started to run remote training classes. Not only that, but recently I started to received interest from clients in Europe and North America as well to help with training, testing, refactoring, and automation (CI). I even managed to sign up two of them. Both of them Perl-related.",
      "It is very interesting to see how an otherwise horrible event changes the world and creates new opportunities as well. It is definitely not how I hoped. I can't use my newly found remote work to travel and work from other locations. Heck I can't even really leave my house these days, and I can't see many of my loved ones. However I hope (oh the naive) that when the pandemic ends in a year or two, we'll come out stronger from it than we were before.",
      "BTW I recommend you listen to the <a href=\"https://distributed.blog/podcast/\">Distributed podcast</a> with Matt Mullenweg. I especially liked the first few episodes, surprisingly the ones that were recorded before the world was forced to work in a distributed mode.",
