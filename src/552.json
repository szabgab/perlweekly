Few days ago, I came across a Facebook post by a friend of mine sharing the news TPF (The Perl Foundation) is looking mentor and project for the year 2022. Please check out the official <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/outreachy-2022\">announcement</a>. I have been following the work done as part of the Outreachy program. In the past, it has supported <a href=\"https://world.openfoodfacts.org/\">Open Food Facts</a>, a very popular Perl based project. To be honest, I find the application process to submit project idea is not smooth. It would be a big help if <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge (Perl & Raku)</a> get the support too. As some of you associated with the project knows it is currently built using Hugo and hosted on <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/theweeklychallenge\">Github</a>. I have been planning to get it over to pure Perl template web based solution e.g. Dancer2 and hosted by real hosting service e.g Digital Ocean. As we grow bigger with times, I find it hard to manage the contributions on GitHub. It takes longer now to process comparatively. If it ever get approved, I can offer to be a mentor to the selected candidate.",
      "There was a good news shared last week about Perl warning i.e. \"signatures are experimental\" is going to disappear for ever with the next major release. I always wanted to have this feature in my Perl. I can't wait for the next release to use it. Do you want to know more about it? Please <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19424\">checkout here</a> for more information.",
      "Do you need help with Perl related queries?",
      "I highly recommend, the two Facebook groups (members only), <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity\">The Perl Community</a> (run and managed by Curtis Poe) and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers\">Perl Programmers</a> (run and managed by Will Braswell).",
      "For parents of school going kids in England, welcome to the daily routine after a week long break. I know it is tough, specially if you have to cover two different schools in the morning rush. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter"
