      "Have you had chance to play with <strong>Perl v5.36</strong>?",
      "If not then please do checkout my <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2022/06/do-you-want-to-get-started-with-perl-v536.html\">blog post</a>, where I shared my first hand experience playing with <strong>Perl v5.36</strong>.",
      "Have you ever thought of contributing to your favourite language, <strong>Perl</strong>?",
      "A little over a decade, I submitted a small patch via email. Those days, the process was not as smooth as it is today. Unfortunately I never received any acknowledgment. Ever since <strong>Perl</strong>, found the new home in <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/perl5\">GitHub</a>, it is so easy to submit the patches. I submitted a <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19853\">small change</a> to the core Perl. To my surprise, in <strong>2 days</strong>, it got accepted and merged. It has given me confidence to submit more.",
      "Why don't you also give it a try?",
