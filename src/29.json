      "Again, lots of interesting articles this week. I was also busy building the first releases of DWIM Perl for Windows and publishing my first e-book about Perl. This a long journey for me, but I am making the first small steps which makes me quite happy.",
      "I have been delaying the work on the back-end for the Perl Weekly for a while, but now, that I am pushing out the news items to 3 social networks I am doing a lot of repeated work. I'll have to put in more time in the code that hopefully will free me up some time reading the news. And coding. There must be some value in automating part of the work.",
