There is a lot of merit in what he is say and what he is writing in this article. I personally would go to the most extreme and use a Docker container for better separation and to make the development, testing, and production environments as similar as possible. With that said I am not 100% sold on the idea. I do understand the value in using the perl that comes with the OS and the perl modules that can be installed with the package-management system of the operating system. (e.g. apt/yum).

      "There are many people who like to get something 'tangible' to really justify their support. If you are such a person I created the Leanpub book especially for you. You can buy the <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/perl-oop/\">Perl OOP book</a> and some of my other books getting a <b>pdf</b> and an <b>epub</b> (for Kindle) version. You will both support my work and get a book. You will also get all the new versions of the book as I update it.",
