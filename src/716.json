     "Hi there,",
     "A few days ago, I wrote a <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/cve-in-perl\">blog post</a> about <strong>CVEs</strong>. It was my first time looking at <strong>CVEs</strong> closely. Then I came across a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1jy9pbe/perl_5402_and_5384_released_with_cve_fix\">reddit post</a> discussing <strong>CVE-2024-56406</strong>. I am a bit confused, was this fixed in <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/5.38.4/perldelta\">Perl v5.38.4</a> or <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5402delta\">Perl v5.40.2</a>?",
     "That said, it gave me something fun to dig into. I already know what I'll be doing next. During my search, I discovered the, <a href=\"https://security.metacpan.org\">CPAN Security Group</a>, a community effort dedicated to handling security incidents on <strong>CPAN</strong>. Pretty cool!",
     "Also the <strong>Perl Toolchain Summit 2025</strong> needs our support as mentioned in the <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-toolchain-summit-2025-needs-you\">blog post</a>. I'm happy to see my current employer, <strong>Oleeo</strong>, listed as one of the <strong>In-Kind Sponsors</strong>. Now, I'm curious to find out who the lucky team member is that gets to attend!. It's happening this year from <strong>Thursday May 1st</strong> to <strong>Sunday May 4th 2025</strong>.",
     "I remember back in <strong>2019</strong>, the summit was held so close to me, in <strong>Marlow</strong>, if I recall correctly. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I have to get involved in the <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> project. The main blocker last time was setting up the local development environment. I spoke to someone about it, can't remember who, and he mentioned the team was working on simplifying the setup process to make it easier for contributors. I haven't had a chance to check the current status, but I'm adding it to my ever-growing <strong>TODO</strong> list.",
     "<strong>Happy Monday</strong> and enjoy the rest of the newsletter!"
