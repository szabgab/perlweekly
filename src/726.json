Most of my courses were geared towards corporations and they are 3-4-5 days long, 8 hours a day covering a lot of subjects. Today it seems we need very short and very focused courses. So I am splitting my long courses into subject and will run those mini-courses. The first 3 I've announced are about <b>Object Oriented Programming in Perl</b>, <b>Functional Programming in Python</b>, and <b>Creating a command line tool in Rust</b>. Check out if any of these courses would be interesting to you or to some of your co workers! If you have question, send me an email.",
