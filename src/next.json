    "In another note, as Yanick is getting more involved in the creation of the Perl Weekly, I (Gabor) might need to start changing the way I write. For example should I start refering to myself in the third person? Or maybe we should each make it clear who is talking in the comments. This latter sounds more personal. For now, I'll add this sig. to some of the entries. What do you think? ~ Gabor"
