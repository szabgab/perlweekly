      "You might know that I talk and write a lot about Open Source and I have a number of open source projects. Mostly web applications. One of them is the <a href=\"https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/\">CPAN Digger</a> where I try to analyze CPAN packages and point to directions for relatively easy improvement. The most basic one would be a link to the public VCS (Version Control System) of the project.",
      "We have some historical data points with <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html\">weekly reports</a>. Around 80% of the recently uploaded distributions have a link to their VCS. It is not bad, but is still 20% less than would be ideal. I am less happy about the fact that only 50% use any CI to check their code before it is released to CPAN.",
