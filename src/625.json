I also updated the README in the <a href=\"https://github.com/szabgab/whitecamel.org\">repository</a>. There are several TODO items. It would be really awesome if you could help me with the site. If you don't know how, then join me in the <a href=\"https://osdc.zulipchat.com/\">OSDC chat</a> and we can discuss it there.",
      "You might remember I used to teach a lot of Perl courses, but then unfortunately that market dried up. I did run a remote training course in 2020 about testing in Perl, but not much else. The pandemic also did not help much with training. Oh yeah, at the beginning of the year I ran an instance of the <a href=\"https://osdc.code-maven.com/\">Open Source Development course</a> with focus on Perl. The video recordings are <a href=\"https://osdc.code-maven.com/osdc-2023-01-perl/\">here</a>. However, I am starting to offer my <a href=\"https://szabgab.com/\">corporate training courses</a> again. It would be great to teach Perl again, but even if it is 'only', Git or GitHub it will be still fun.",
      "Lastly for today: The <a href=\"https://perlkohacon.fi/\">Perl and Koha conference</a> is going to place August 14-18, 2023, Helsinki, Finland. You still have a month to get there!",
      "Enjoy the week!"
