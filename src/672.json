      "To be honest, I have been watching the <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> for the updates almost every day for the last one week. The wait was over finally on Sunday late evening UK time. You can certainly take a <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5400delta\">closer look</a> if you want. I am going to install the latest bundle in the next couple of days and play with it. Having said, I am a bit disappointed to find out that <strong>role</strong> is not yet implemented in the core OO. I understand the workload on the team, specially <strong>Paul Evans</strong>. I wish and hope he gets the support and helping hands in getting the outstanding features done quickly. Reason I am curious about <strong>role</strong> is that I am working on something that uses the new OO syntax and I need to implement <strong>role</strong> using it. Unfortunately it has to wait until another big release. Still I am very happy with all other new features. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire team for all the hard work in getting the release done in a timely fashion. You guys are doing a great job. The entire <strong>Perl</strong> community is proud of you all. With all the support around, we will get the glory back very soon.",
