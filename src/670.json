Depending on your availability and convenience, I would highly recommend you register your interest to your choice(s) of conference. And if you are attending then do take the plunge give your first talk if you have not done so before. It doesn't have to be long talk, you can try quick 5 minutes lightning talk to begin with.",

Well there is a bonus for all attending the event, <strong>Damian Conway</strong> would be giving a keynote remotely. I am sure, it is going to be a memorable moment to celebrate the <strong>25th anniversary</strong>. Similarly, <strong>London Perl Workshop</strong> would be celebrating <strong>20th anniversary</strong> this year. I wanted to attend the TPRC 2024 in Las Vegas but for personal reason I am unable to attend. What a shame but at least I am definitely going to be part of LPW 2024 as it is local to me.
