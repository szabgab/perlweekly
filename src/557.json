      "Learning programming languages is not easy, but if you compare that to learning human languages you'll notice that it has a lot more difficulties. Human languages have much bigger vocabulary and much bigger grammar with lots of exceptions. This already makes it much harder to learn on, but in addition it is hard to get fast and cheap feedback. Something you are given by the compiler/interpreter of your language. You can even add more by writing your own tests and setting up a CI system. That's part of the value <a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\">DuoLingo</a> provides. Fast and cheap feedback. However it is proprietary.  <a href=\"https://librelingo.app/\">LibreLingo</a> is an open source alternative to which I started to contribute. The most fun part for me is actually trying to write a course: building a dictionary and writing sample sentences.",
