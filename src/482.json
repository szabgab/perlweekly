      "Are you active on Facebook? If yes then you should join the weekly \"Perl Town Hall\" host by Will Braswell. It is weekly live video session every Friday. I do join the show whenever I get time. Because of time difference, it usually comes live midnight Friday. Credit goes to Will for putting up such a nice show mix of Perl news. I just hope if it is available for wider audience outside of Facebook. Feel free to join the Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/\">\"Perl Programmers\"</a>, so that you don't miss the fun every week. The best part is you can interact with him live during the show.",
