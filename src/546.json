      "Hi there",
      "Welcome to my first edition of the year 2022 and <strong>95th edition</strong> overall.",
      "I remember, there was a time when <strong>O'Reilly</strong> group published many Perl books. Then came few other publishing house, like <strong>Manning</strong> publication. I am sure you must have owned handfull of Perl books from these publishers. Recent times, not many Perl books written, except one or two by <strong>brian d foy</strong>. A friend of mine, donated all his Perl books to a local library as he is moving to Python. It is sad state to be honest. Recently, I came across a <strong>Facebook</strong> post by a friend of mine about a perl book <strong>Extending and Embedding Perl</strong>. I knew about it but never had the chance to read it. So I decided to buy a used copy from <strong>Amazon</strong>. I must confess, I was missing a big deal. If you haven't read it then you must check out. I am sure, you can find online <strong>FREE</strong> copy. By the way, I have kept all my Perl books safe. I like to read physical book and not online version.",
      "With new years, there is a trend of new year resolution. As far as I am concerned, I stopped making any resolution two years ago. But this year, I decided to make one and stick to it. And the resolution is to get the draft of my first Perl book out as soon as possible. It has been going on for months now. It is embarassing now to even talk about it. There are so many things going on at the same time, I hardly find time for the book. Please wish me luck.",
      "Long time ago, <strong>Gabor</strong>, started a compaign to do live video on Perl. He even did few pair-programming sessions and it was very popular. But then there has been no noise on that front in recent time. I used to do <strong>YouTube</strong> for the weekly challenge during the middle of last year and then I also stopped it because of lack of time. Last month, I started doing video again for the weekly challenge. It gives me immense pleasure when I see comments on my video. Someone recently commented on one my video and requested I should do videos of past challenges as well. I have to manage my time carefully otherwise my first book would be neglected again. Having said, I am not giving up on making video for weekly challenge. If you are interested then please do check out my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar\">YouTube Channel</a>.",
      "There is one good news shared by <strong>Curtis</strong> that the MMVP (minimally minimal viable product) RFC for Corinna has been sent to P5P. I am keeping my fingers crossed.",
      "Last but not the least, you please look after yourself and loved ones."
