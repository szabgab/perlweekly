      "Hi there",
      "Welcome to my first edition of 2022 and <strong>95th edition</strong> overall.",
      "I remember there was a time when the <strong>O'Reilly</strong> group published many Perl books. Then came a few other publishing houses like <strong>Manning</strong> publications. I am sure you must have owned a handful of Perl books from these publishers. In recent times not many Perl books have been written, except one or two by <strong>brian d foy</strong>. A friend of mine donated all his Perl books to a local library as he is moving to Python. It is a sad state to be honest. Recently, I came across a <strong>Facebook</strong> post by a friend of mine about a Perl book called <strong>Extending and Embedding Perl</strong>. I knew about it but I had never had the chance to read it. So I decided to buy a used copy from <strong>Amazon</strong>. I must confess I was missing a great deal. If you haven't read it then you must check it out. By the way, I have kept all my Perl books safe. I like to read physical books and not online versions.",
      "With a new year, there is a tradition of new year resolutions. As far as I am concerned, I stopped making any resolutions two years ago. But this year, I decided to make one and stick to it. And the resolution is to get the draft of my first Perl book out as soon as possible. It has been going on for months now. It is embarassing now to even talk about it. There are so many things going on at the same time, I hardly find time for the book. Please wish me luck.",
      "A long time ago, <strong>Gabor</strong> started a campaign to make live videos about Perl. He even did few pair-programming sessions and they were very popular. But then there has been no noise on that front in recent times. I used to make <strong>YouTube</strong> videos for the Weekly Challenge during the middle of last year and then I also stopped because of lack of time. Last month, I started making videos again for the Weekly Challenge. It gives me immense pleasure when I see comments on my videos. Someone recently commented on one video and requested I should make videos of past challenges as well. I have to manage my time carefully otherwise my first book would be neglected again. Having said that, I am not giving up on making videos for the Weekly Challenge. If you are interested then please do check out my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar\">YouTube Channel</a>.",
      "There is one piece of good news shared by <strong>Curtis</strong> - that the MMVP (minimally minimal viable product) RFC for Corinna has been sent to P5P. I am keeping my fingers crossed.",
      "Last but not least, please look after yourself and your loved ones."
