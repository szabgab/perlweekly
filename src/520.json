It is the introduction of new metric, \"CPAN Bus Factor\". Don't know what I am talking about? Well then you should read the <a href=\"https://www.olafalders.com/2021/06/30/cpan-bus-factor/\">blog post</a>, which is a collaborative work by Neil Bowers and Olaf Alders.",
      "It reminds me an incident from the past when I received an email from Neil Bowers about one of my CPAN distribution, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/IP::Info\">IP::Info</a> as he was reviewing CPAN modules for locating an IP address. Later he published his <a href=\"http://neilb.org/reviews/ip-location.html\">report</a> on 8th Aug 2012. You can take a look collection of <a href=\"http://neilb.org/reviews/\">CPAN module reviews</a> by him. If my memory serves, Neil also ran <a href=\"http://cpan-weekly.org/\">CPAN Weekly</a>, for a while. I did join the mailing list and the received CPAN Weekly newsletter talking about a CPAN module and its usage every week. Unfortunately it is no longer active.",
      "A long time ago, I used to be an active CPAN contributor. Unfortunately, because of time constraints, I'm no longer as active as I used to be. I even wrote a two-part blog post on the subject - \"How to become a CPAN contributor?\" - for perl.com in 2018. You can check out the posts, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor/\">Part 1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor-part-2/\">Part 2</a>, if you are interested.",
      "Why am I talking about CPAN contributions?",
      "A friend of mine and fellow contributor to <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge</a>, Cheok-Yin Fung, wrote a <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/c_y_fung/2021/07/how-i-uploaded-a-cpan-module.html\">blog</a> about her experience of uploading her first distribution to CPAN. It reminds me of my early days of struggle with CPAN. These days there is a lot of help available on various public platforms. I wish her all the best and welcome to the club of CPAN contributors.",
      "I came across a very interesting <a href=\"https://medium.com/codex/how-to-create-awesome-pull-requests-b634e7f00e47z\">blog post</a> by JJ Merelo talking about Pull Request do's and don'ts. Very helpful advice for anyone looking to contribute to open source projects in general.",
      "Enjoy the rest of the newsletter."
