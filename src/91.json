      "Last week, Yanick included the link to the Pinto fund-raising. A few hours after the Perl Weekly was published, I checked and I saw about 20 new contributions and the project is now 3/4 funded. You are awesome. Thank you!",
      "In light of this success, I included a link to the Crowdtilt page again. Maybe another 20 people will want to contribute helping the campaign to reach its target.",
      "In another note, Let me remind you that both YAPC::NA and YAPC::EU are getting closer. I have been to more than 10 such events and they are great. Not only can you learn a lot from the presentations, but meeting the people who build and maintain perl and a large chunk of CPAN is awesome. I remember at first it was a bit intimidating, but I quickly found out that some of them are actually nice people.",
      "So if you can get to either of those events I'd highly recommend. It's fun, educational, and it is good for your work. (Pick any 2 you'd tell your boss.) Links at the bottom.",
      "See you"
