At the last event I organized we sent 4 Pull-Request in 1.5 hour. If you have not contributed yet then at first it might take a bit longer for you, but with some practice you can make some contribution within an hour. So one hour every week for the next 52 weeks. Here is an <a href=\"https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/633\">issue on GitHub</a> where you can mention your work. That will help all of us to keep doing it.",
