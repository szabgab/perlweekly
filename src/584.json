You still have plenty of time to submit at least <strong>4 Pull Requests</strong> to qualified repositories in <strong>GitHub</strong> or <strong>GitLab</strong>. If you are new to <strong>Hacktoberfest</strong> then I suggest you please take a look at <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.com/participation\">this page</a>.",

I have received the specially designed <strong>T-shirt</strong> every year after completing the challenge ever since. As far as <strong>Perl</strong> is concerned, there are plenty of choices we have. However you have to make sure the open source project is taking part in the <strong>Hacktoberfest</strong> event. As mentioned in the official note, you have to be quick as only the first <strong>40,000</strong> participants who complete the challenge are eligible to receive the <strong>FREE T-shirt</strong>.",
      "Almost all my opensource contributions are hosted on <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar\">GitHub</a>, you are FREE to pick any from <strong>GitLab</strong> too. If you are like me, then you can pick and choose the participating repository from the <a href=\"https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest?l=perl\">list here</a>. Having said, if you are still not sure then I would recommend two fun open source projects, <a href=\"https://pullrequest.club/hello\">Pull Request Club</a> run by <strong>Kivanc Yizan</strong> and <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a>.",

I sincerely request you all who participated in the past and would like to attend the event next year. Please do share with your friends too.
