One of them is the creation of <strong>Perl Steering Council</strong> and we even get the weekly update too.

A fellow <strong>Team PWC</strong> member, <strong>Cheok-Yin Fung</strong> started series where she talks about popular and usefull <strong>CPAN</strong> module. Latest in the series is about <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/c_y_fung/2023/03/graph---weekly-travelling-in-cpan.html\">Graph</a>. If you like the idea then do share your comments and encourge her. I am so proud of her. I would also like to mention about the work recently done by <strong>Dave Cross</strong> i.e. <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2023/03/improvements-to-planet-perl-and-perlanet\">Improvements to Planet Perl and Perlanet</a>.",
