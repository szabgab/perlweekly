      "I have been trying to start this for at least 6 month and kept failing, but finally it's here. I've started to conduct interviews with fellow Perl Developers. The first interview was with Jeff Thalhammer (Perl::Critic and Pinto) and the second one was with Michael Schwern (Test::Simple, Test::More). I hope these interviews will help you see the humans behind the nicknames and the CPAN modules. (see links below). I already have a few more interviews planned, but if you have specific people you'd like to see interviewed, please let me know. Also if you have specific questions you'd want to ask. (Though I cannot promise anything, I'll try to take the requests in account.)",
