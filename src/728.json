      "Hi there,",
      "Last week was packed with two major gatherings for <strong>Perl</strong> enthusiasts: <strong>The Perl Community Conference (Hybrid) Summer 2025</strong> and <strong>The Perl and Raku Conference 2025</strong>. Both events brought together developers, contributors and fans from around the world, whether in person or online.",
      "Unfortunately, I couldn't attend either conference this time but I'm eager to catch up on what I missed. If you were there, I'd love to hear about your experience. <strong>Makoto Nozaki</strong> has already shared one: <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/makoto_nozaki/2025/07/tprc-greenville-2025.html\">event report</a>, thank you for that. If others have insights, talks or highlights to share, please do.",
      "For those curious about the talks, the official <strong>PCC 2025</strong> schedule is available <a href=\"https://perlcommunity.org\">here</a>. I spotted a live talk link on <strong>Facebook</strong> and joined briefly, but due to audio issues, I had to drop out. Fingers crossed that recordings or slides will be shared soon for those of us who couldn't attend fully.",
      "One thing, I noticed this year, there wasn't much pre-event promotion for individual talks or maybe I just missed it on social media? Either way, if you couldn't make it, keep an eye out for uploaded slides and summaries. There's always something new to learn!",
      "That's all for now, enjoy the rest of the newsletter and happy coding.."
