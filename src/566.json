      "Finally we have yet another feature packed release <strong>Perl v5.36</strong>, thanks to the entire team involved.",
      "Do you want to know all about the latest release? If yes then please refer to the <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/RJBS/perl-5.36.0/view/pod/perldelta.pod\">official page</a> for more informations.",
      "The very first question comes to our mind after the <strong>Perl v5.36</strong> release is <strong>What happened to v7?</strong>",
      "The Perl Steering Council (PSC) came up with the detailed response about everything including <strong>v7</strong> in the <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/2022/05/what-happened-to-perl-7.html\">official blog</a> page.",
      "I have been closely following the development of Modern OO in core Perl i.e. <strong>Corinna</strong>. I am now looking forward to the next release i.e. <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>, which is likely to introduce <strong>Corinna</strong>. So the next question, how long is the wait? I am told, we can expect it in about a year time from now. To be honest, I am happy to wait.",
      "Together with <strong>v7</strong> and <strong>Corinna</strong>, I am confident it would bring fresh air and positive energy among the community. I would urge everyone, please don't loose hope and stay strong together.",
      "I am running daily <strong>Perl</strong> feature post sharing the bits that I didn't know before or never used before. It goes back to <strong>Perl v5.10</strong>. It has brought back <strong>Perl</strong> to the discussion table. I have learnt a lot of edge cases about each feature by many experts on various social platforms e.g. <strong>Facebook Groups</strong> like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity\">Perl Community</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers\">Perl Programmers</a>. If you are active on <strong>Twitter</strong> then you can follow the <strong>Perl</strong> feature post on my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cpan_author\">personal twitter handle</a>. If you are interested in the past feature post then you can take a look at my dedicated <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets\">GitHub repository</a>. If you have suggestions to improve then please feel free to submit pull request.",
