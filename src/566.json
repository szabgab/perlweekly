      "Hi there,",
      "Finally we have yet another feature packed release <strong>Perl v5.36</strong>, thanks to the entire team involved.",
      "Do you want to know all about the latest release? If yes then please refer to the <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/RJBS/perl-5.36.0/view/pod/perldelta.pod\">official page</a> for more informations.",
      "The very first question comes to our mind after the <strong>Perl v5.36</strong> release is <strong>What happened to v7?</strong>",
      "The Perl Steering Council (PSC) came up with the detailed response about everything including <strong>v7</strong> in the <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/2022/05/what-happened-to-perl-7.html\">official blog</a> page.",
      "I have been closely following the development of Modern OO in core Perl i.e. <strong>Corinna</strong>. I am now looking forward to the next release i.e. <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>, which is likely to introduce <strong>Corinna</strong>. So the next question, how long is the wait? I am told, we can expect it in about a year time from now. To be honest, I am happy to wait.",
      "Together with <strong>v7</strong> and <strong>Corinna</strong>, I am confident it would bring fresh air and positive energy among the community. I would urge everyone, please don't loose hope and stay strong together.",
      "I am running daily <strong>Perl</strong> feature post sharing the bits that I didn't know before or never used before. It goes back to <strong>Perl v5.10</strong>. It has brought back <strong>Perl</strong> to the discussion table. I have learnt a lot of edge cases about each feature by many experts on various social platforms e.g. <strong>Facebook Groups</strong> like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity\">Perl Community</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers\">Perl Programmers</a>. If you are active on <strong>Twitter</strong> then you can follow the <strong>Perl</strong> feature post on my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cpan_author\">personal twitter handle</a>. If you are interested in the past feature post then you can take a look at my dedicated <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets\">GitHub repository</a>. If you have suggestions to improve then please feel free to submit pull request.",
      "We are having week off from school duty as it is school holiday time. Double that up with Queen's Jubilee celebration, wow. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter."
