      "I like working on legacy code whether it is Perl, Python or some other language, because it is code that is already very valuable to the organization that uses it. It is great to help the maintainers understand the code better and to give them confidence in making changes to the code.",
      "There are a number of language specific tools that can help you while dealing with legacy code. For example Perl Critic which is mentioned in at least two posts this edition. There are more generic things, like setting up a good CI system which is mentioned by Gugod.",
      "The ideal situation is when both management and the engineers really want the change. They still probably need some external help from someone who has experience in similar situations and who has already seen systems where the engineers have no fear in making changes. It is a totally different world than what many people experience in organizations.",
