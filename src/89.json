      "I am really glad to tell you, that since the translation to Portuguese started a month ago, a few other people came on board and started to translate the Perl Maven Tutorial to their languages. So we already have the beginning of a Romanian and a Russian translation, and a few more that I'll let you know once the first article gets published. I believe that making the language more accessible to people for whom English is not that easy can bring them to the point where they are ready to improve their English too, to learn more Perl.",
