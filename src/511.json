      "There have now been more words spent on the improper way TPF in general and CAT in particular handled the abusive behavior than the decade-long harassment and abuse by - let's keep to the tradition - Individual 1. Some of the lieutenants of the abuser demand evidence, but this is just a well known tactic for silencing them. As we all know abused and harassed people rarely speak up. Partially because they know the lieutenants will then try to discredit them and they will receive further harassment and abuse. I am not suprised that many people leave their active role in Perl or withdraw from certain parts of the Perl community and I am not surprised that most of them do it silently. After publishing this I fully expect the team will now restart harassing me as well or will just keep spreading lies about me.",
