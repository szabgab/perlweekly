A work colleague who does <strong>mentoring</strong> as part of his role, is by far the best mentor, I have met so far. I learn something new every day from him by just joining him on daily standup. Although my contribution to the standup is nothing but it feels nice to see young blood with so much energy. I wish I had mentor like him when I started.",

      "Is it easy to be a mentor?",
      "You would think so but I can tell you it is not. You have to have patience first thing first. I have seen how difficult it is to be a mentor. I would like to share a sweet moment with you. A month ago, a young blood interested to learn <strong>Perl</strong> reached out to me on <strong>Facebook</strong>. At times, I wonder how did he find out about me. His question was, how do I execute <strong>Hello World</strong> script, he has already created. He was using VSCode editor. I am not a big fan of VSCode editor but in the current role, I got the opportunity to use it. Having said, I still use <strong>vim</strong> for everything else. Back to the story, we started talking on <strong>Facebook</strong> messenger. I find it hard to convey message on messenger. So I requested him to join on <strong>Team video call</strong>. It took <strong>2 minutes</strong> call to resolve the issue. While there, I showed him few other things beyond, <strong>hello world</strong>. I am sure, he would carry on exploring the language further.",
      "Is it mostly about <strong>Perl</strong>?",
      "In my personal experience, no. I was once contacted by a member of <strong>Team PWC</strong> with regard to the <strong>git related issues</strong> as he couldn't submit his contribution to the weekly challenge. So there again, we jumped on <strong>Team video call</strong> and in no time, he was good to go. Just to be explicit here, he was not a newbie but an experienced techie with way more than experience than me. It feels great to help. It is not one-way traffic as when I get stuck, I know who to contact. Luckily I get instant help too, so far. Few months ago, when I used to do <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar\">YouTube video</a>, I had trouble with <strong>OBS Studio</strong>. I asked for help on <strong>Twitter</strong>. You wouldn't believe, I had more help than I expected from <strong>Olaf Alders</strong>, <strong>Lance Wicks</strong> and <strong>Julien Fiegehenn</strong>. I now have working environment back, although I am not doing live video any more because of lack of time.",
      "For those, need help can reach out to me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cpan_author\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mohammad.s.anwar\">Facebook</a>. I must make this clear, I will not do your course work. I am available for anyone anytime as I literally spend <strong>12-14 hours</strong> in front of machine every day.",
      "Have a great week and enjoy rest of the newsletter."
