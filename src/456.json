      "COVID-19 forced us to stay at home for sometime now. Do you miss attending conference? Luckily TPF is organising the Conference in the Cloud. It is going to be a 3-days event from 24-26 June 2020. If you would like to interact with the speakers and other attendees then you will need to pay registration fee $10. If you would like to be one of the speaker then you can submit your talk proposal by May 2 at 00:01 UTC. It is official called The Perl and Raku Conference in the Cloud (TPRCiC). Please check out the <a href=\"https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud\">page</a> for more information.",
      "Have you tried Git Workflows? Curtis recently shared the <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/git-workflow\">git tools</a> used by his company for software development. It is the best example of Git Workflows, in my humble opinion.",
      "This is my 50th edition of Perl Weekly newsletter. Next month, I will complete 2 years of association with Perl Weekly. Thank you Gabor Szabo for giving me the opportunity.",
      "Last but not the least, stay safe and stay indoor, if possible. Enjoy reading this week newsletter."
