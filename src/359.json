      "Hi there,",
      "In 2 weeks search.cpan.org will shut down. All the links will redirect to the appropriate pages on <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/\">MetaCPAN</a>. Soon after that Google will take the pages of s.c.o. out of their index and MetaCPAN will become the leading result on Google and elsewhere.",
      "In addition, as we just learned, CPANRatings is going to become read-only and MetaCPAN will soon have a replacement service.",
      "Exiting times as MetaCPAN will suddenly have 3 times its current traffic.",
      "This would be a great time to start contributing to MetaCPAN to improve its search results and whatever you think could work better. You could even build an alternative UI in plain JavaScript. If you'd like to know how, send me and email!",
      "In any case, enjoy your week!"
