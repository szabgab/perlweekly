    ts: 2013.01.23
    text: The rise of the machines is upon us. And it's adorable. A new major version of Parrot, codenamed for the lovable cousin of
    the T-800, is out. Amongst other things, it now comes with yummy thread support.

  - title: Improving Perl’s New Programmer Outreach
    url: http://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2013/01/22/improving-perls-new-programmer-outreach/
    ts: 2013.01.22
    text: So, there's that concept that Perl is kinda undead flying around.  And, as gothic literature taught us, the Coded Undead (also known as Nosferaturings) need a constant input of young blood if they don't want to crumble into dusty irrelevance. In a somewhat related spirit, VM Brasseur discusses how we could, and should, improve our outreach to new programmers to keep our continued existence on the road to sparkliness.

    text: You want to carve into your name into the very code of Perl, but fear your hack-fu is not strong enough?  Balderdash! Here's a meta-ticket corralling a bunch of smaller tasks that don't require the mastery of eldritch technologies. Verily, only a wee bit of elbow grease stands before you and history, so hurry up!

    url: http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog/entry/newsmill
    ts: 2013.01.20
    text: By "guest-editing the Perl Weekly", Gabor meant "write a new database
    backend for it". And a web front-end. With HTML 5 shinies, and perhaps use
    a pet templating system while we are at it? ... Right?
