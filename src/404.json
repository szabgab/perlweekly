For \"Perl Advocacy\", David Farrell was the winner for PerlTricks and Perl.com. Last but not the least, in the category \"Perl User Groups\", Max Maischein was picked as winner. Max Maischein has been Frakfurt.pm's treasurer since 2011, handling the accounting, reporting, and contracting, as well as coordinating work with other local organizations.
