It hardly has anything to do with Perl, but I needed it and it can be a useful to others as well. Actually it originated from a discussion I had with my son who is using Python. So first I wrote the article <a href=\"https://code-maven.com/ansi-command-line-colors-with-python\">ANSI colors using Python</a> and only after that I converted it to Perl.",
