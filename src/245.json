     "YAPC::EU is in August, but it does not have a web site yet.",
     "The list of <a href=\"http://www.yapcna.org/yn2016/tutorials.html\">tutorials</a> at YAPC::NA is already available including the one I am giving on hooking up AngularJS and Bootstrap to a Perl backend. Although the schedule of YAPC::NA is not available yet, based on the talks from previous years you can be sure it will be a blast. Don't miss it!",
