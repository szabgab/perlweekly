At the time, when Perl is making comeback so nicely, this came as a shocker. We need him more now to be actively involved and take us to a new heights. Having said, I do respect his decision and wish him all the best. I hope to meet him once again personally at some Perl conference.",

Sawyer was the man behind the camera recording the talk. At the end of the talk, Sawyer came up to me and suggested how I can automate some of the tasks I mentioned in the talk. It was a big fan moment for me. Everything is still so fresh in my mind.",
