      "The highlight of the recently concluded <a href=\"https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/\">\"Conference in the Cloud\"</a> is the announcement of \"Perl 7\" by Sawyer X. It is the best news that I have come across recently. Personally, I think it would help all Perl devs cheer up and something nice to talk about. It would be great if Cor makes it to \"Perl 7\" in time. I am very excited about \"Perl 7\" and looking forward to it.",
      "With the announcement of Perl 7, came another announcement by brian d foy about his latest book <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/preparing_for_perl7\">\"Preparing for Perl 7\"</a>. I had the pleasure to read it first hand and I must confess that it is the best introduction to Perl 7. Thanks brian d foy.",
      "I attended the \"Conference in the Cloud\" and I had mix feeling. There was time, I was very excited and there was time, I was not so excited. Overall, I would say it was a successfull online event with all the limitations. Having said it, I still prefer face-2-face conference. I hope and wish we get one soon. Happy to hear the announcement of <a href=\"http://act.yapc.eu/gpw2021/index.html\">German Perl Workshop 2021</a>. I am keeping my fingers crossed for more such announcement.",
