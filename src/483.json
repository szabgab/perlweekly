      "Events: There are a number of <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/events.html\">online Perl events</a> but as I can see all them are in English and in the evening hours in North America. They could be great for people in South America as well, and maybe even for people in Australia and the Far East. There is also a French and a German even, but they are both seem to be scheduled to be face-to-face. Are they brave or irresponsible? See the list at the bottom of each edition as well.",
      "More VCS links, more CI: As you might have seen a few weeks ago I've started to include some <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html\">statistics</a> in the newsletter. Specifically I am interested to see how many of the CPAN packages have a link to their VCS in the META files allowing MetaCPAN to display that link. I am also very interested to see how many of these projects use a CI system connected to their VCS. My goal now is to increase this ratio. I even <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/cpan-digger\">wrote about it</a>. My goal is to reduce the no VCS to 5% and the no CI to 30% by the end of the year. If you think this work adds value to the Perl community then you could help me with the technical part yourself or by <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/szabgab\">supporting my efforts</a>. Oh, and if your company wants to set up Test Automation and a CI system, I can help with that too.",
