     "What an honour to present the 500th edition of the Perl Weekly newsletter. Thank you Gabor Szabo.",
     "Let's begin the week with the good news, rt.cpan.org is staying. You can find more details <a href=\"https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/02/msg259168.html\">here</a>.",
     "Andrew Shitov raised an <a href=\"https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/263\">issue</a> with regard to have separate entity \"The Raku Foundation\". Feel free to share your views on the subject.",
     "Did you know Cor is now given new name, Corinna?",
     "Curtis Poe recently requested the general public to share their views of Corinna being in the Perl core. Please do checkout the <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki\">wiki page</a>",
      "This week, we celebrated the 100th week of <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a>. I even created <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr0Xz2BYvXU\">YouTube Video</a> to thank Team PWC for their support and encouragements.",
      "After a long time, I got the opportunity to Pair Programming. Thanks to my friend, Julien Fiegehenn, we spent an hour and half long session and got <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/MooX-Clone\">MooX::Clone</a> released to CPAN in the end. It all started when I was working on my latest project <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/design-patterns\">Design Patterns using Modern Perl</a>, more specifically, <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/design-patterns/tree/master/15-prototype\">Prototype Design Pattern</a> where I was looking for clean interface to create clone of Moo object.",
      "Zum ersten Mal teilen wir <a href=\"https://blog.perl-academy.de\">Blogs</a> in nicht-englischer Sprache. Ich hoffe es w√ºrde unseren deutschen Lesern gefallen.",
