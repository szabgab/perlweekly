If you don't know, that's the list where people who maintain and develop the Perl compiler/interpreter discuss what they are working on, which features are added to perl and which are removed. If you don't have a lot of time but still would like to know what's planned for perl, this could be a very useful resource for you! In this entry, probably the most important news is the release of 5.17.1, the first developer snapshot for next year's release of 5.18. Try it.",
