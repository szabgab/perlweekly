      "One of the interesting topics is the list of features some people would like perl to have. It is interesting but might be very misleading. The people who write and comment on these blogs are just a small set of people (and companies) using Perl. It would be important to see what companies, eg. CTOs of companies using Perl find as important. What features they would lile to see in Perl. So this is for you, dear reader. If you are a CxO or VP RnD of a company using Perl, speak up. I'd be happy to proxy your message, in case you don't know who to talk to.",
