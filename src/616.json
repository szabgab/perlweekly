      "When I say <strong>India</strong>, I mean <strong>Indian Subcontinent</strong> i.e. Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Srilanka. Having said, my prime concern is <strong>India</strong> right now. You must have realised the context of <strong>Camel</strong> by now. Today I would like to talk about the popularity of <strong>Perl</strong> in <strong>India</strong>. I remember when I left <strong>India</strong> in <strong>2000</strong>, it was on the rise and that is how I got into <strong>Perl Programming</strong>. After moving to <strong>England</strong>, I noticed how frequent the <strong>Perl</strong> fans meetup and share ideas. I got the opportunity to attend some and realised how it can boost the popularity of the language and spread the positive word among newbies. Regular <strong>Perl Mongers</strong> meet also keep the subject live and active.",
      "Ever since the <strong>COVID</strong> happened, all these in-person events stopped initially. But the good news is that we are getting back on track with the events like <a href=\"https://tprc.to/tprc-2023-tor\">The Perl and Raku Conference 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://perlkohacon.fi\">Perl and Koha Conference in Helsinki</a>. I have decided to attend <strong>The Perl and Raku Conference in Canada</strong>. I have submitted talk proposal too, little late though. I am still waiting for the acceptance. The other conference is clashing with my planned visit to <strong>India</strong> unfortunately.",
      "Going back to the main topic, I am wondering if we ever had any <strong>Perl Conference in India</strong>. I am aware of active <strong>Perl Mongers</strong> but never heard of their activities. In the year <strong>2021</strong>, <strong>Will Braswell</strong> reached out to me with a proposal to do <strong>The Perl Conference in India</strong>. Because of <strong>COVID</strong>, we put it on hold then. At the time, we decided to do month long tour to cover major cities spending 2-3 days in each city. I suggested the best time would be <strong>August</strong> as I will have long summer break. We would definitely need sponsors, ideally if we do under the banner of <strong>The Perl Foundation</strong> then the reach would be even greater, in my humble opinion. The local <strong>Perl Mongers</strong> group can be handy in organising the event. I would be eager to know if any <strong>Perl Mongers</strong> group interested in these events. I would expect the groups down south would be more active as they are highly aware of technologies in general.",
