Some subscribers who have not received the newsletter earlier started to receive it, others stopped receiving it. The big difference is that now I see a report of who has not received it. For example I see many @cpan.org addresses in the bounce list. That's just sad. I got some offers to use other services, free of charge, but frankly I am quite tired of fighting the SPAM filters.",
