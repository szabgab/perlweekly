I did see some activities in the GitHub repository for <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong>. I was hoping to see another exciting edition full of Perl projects. A friend of mine on <strong>Facebook</strong> mentioned that this year <a href=\"http://perladvent.org/2021/index.html\">Perl Advent Calendar</a> is looking a bit sparse. At the time of writing this editorial, I only saw <a href=\"http://perladvent.org/2021/2021-12-01.html\">one post</a> i.e. Day 1 of Year 2021. Being one of many contributors in the past, I am sad to see the current state. I have absolutely no idea what happened this year. I know I have too many things already on my plate but I would like to help to get <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong> back to its original glory.",

We have been running this since the beginning i.e. <strong>2019</strong>. You will find some of the fun tasks from the past one year being discussed by members of <strong>Team PWC</strong>. I have made slight change to the look and feel this time. I hope you like it too",
      "How about <a href=\"https://24pullrequests.com\">24 Pull Requests</a> event?",
      "I have not seen it being discussed either on any of the social platforms e.g. <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong> or <strong>LinkedIn</strong>. I haven't had chance to take part this year. I couldn't take part last year too, what a shame. I still have 10 days and I have booked few days off from work. So there is a possibility I might take part and even complete the challenge. Please wish me luck.",
      "Last but not the least, <strong>Curtis</strong>, leading the project <strong>Corinna</strong>, announced that he had a great meeting with the Perl Steering Council and they are extremely receptive to Corinna going into the core. I can't wait for <strong>Corinna</strong> being part of core Perl. <strong>Damian</strong> shared the details on one of issues discussed in the same meeting in the <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2021/12/a-not-so-simple-matter-of-privacy.html\">blog</a>. You definitely don't want to miss it.",
