      "Hi there!",
      "On Saturday, (evening for me, noon-ish in the Americas) we had an excellent meeting and there are recordings you can watch. In the first hour I showed some PRs I sent to MIME::Lite. You can watch the <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/testing-mime-lite-video\">video here</a>. In the second hour we changed the setup and we continued in driver-navigator style pair programming. I was giving the instructions and two other participants made the changes and sent the PR. Others in the audience made suggestions. So actually this was <a href=\"https://mobprogramming.org/\">mob programming</a>. As far as I know, this was the first time they contributed to open source projects. One of the PRs was already accepted while we were still in the meeting. Talk about quick feedback and fast ROI. You can watch the <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/meta-data-and-github-actions-video\">video here</a>. Don't forget to 'like' the videos on YouTube and to follow the channel!",
      "I've scheduled the next such event. <a href=\"https://luma.com/perl-maven\">Register here!</a>. My hope is that many more of you will participate and then after getting a taste and having some practice you'll spend 15-20 min a day (2 hours a week) on similar contributions. Having 10-20 or maybe even 100 people doing that consistently will have a huge impact on Perl within a year.",
      "Before that, however, there is the <a href=\"https://perlfoundation.org/fosdem/community-dinner.html\">FOSDEM Community dinner on Saturday</a>. If you are in Brussels.",
      "Enjoy your week!"
