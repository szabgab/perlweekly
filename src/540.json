      "Did you participate in <strong>Hacktoberfest 2021</strong>?",
      "If not then you have one more chance to participate in the global event <a href=\"https://24pullrequests.com\">24 Pull Requests</a>. Participation is simple, you just have submit one pull qequest each day between 1st Dec 2021 and 24th Dec 2021. It is one of my favourite events. I have participated in the event each year, without a break, since 2015. I was introduced to it by <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2015/11/24-pull-requests.html\">Neil Bowers</a>. Last year I was going through rough patch so, unfortunately, I had to skip it. My best performance was in the year 2018 when I contributed <strong>125 pull requests</strong> in the first 24 days of December. If I am not mistaken then the <strong>24 Pull Requests</strong> event is little more relaxed as compare to <strong>Hacktoberfest</strong>. You don't have to submit a pull request every day. Instead, you can submit in bulk on one day and then takea break. However, make sure you have submitted 24 pull requests by the end of play on 24th December.",
