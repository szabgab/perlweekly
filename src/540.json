      "Did you participate in <strong>Hacktoberfest 2021</strong>?",
      "If not then you have one more chance to participate in the global event <a href=\"https://24pullrequests.com\">24 Pull Requests</a>. Participation is simple, you just have to submit one pull request each day between 1st Dec 2021 and 24th Dec 2021. It is one of my favourite events. I have participated in the event each year, without a break, since 2015. I was introduced to it by <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2015/11/24-pull-requests.html\">Neil Bowers</a>. Last year I was going through rough patch so, unfortunately, I had to skip it. My best performance was in the year 2018 when I contributed <strong>125 pull requests</strong> in the first 24 days of December. If I am not mistaken then the <strong>24 Pull Requests</strong> event is little more relaxed as compare to <strong>Hacktoberfest</strong>. You don't have to submit a pull request every day. Instead, you can submit in bulk one day and then take a break. However, make sure you have submitted at least 24 pull requests by the end of play on 24th December.",

It doesn’t know what objects are.</strong>\"",
