      "Hi there",
      "I am sure many of you are aware of <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org\">Outreachy</a>. It all started with GNOME's Women's Summer Outreach Program (WSOP) in 2006. The idea was to encourage women's participation in Open Source projects. In 2009, the GNOME community revived the program to encourage more women to contribute to GNOME and renamed it to GNOME Outreach Program for Women. It became a very popular program in no time and successfully brought in more women into the fold. The program was further expanded with more organisations joining in e.g. Fedora, Mozilla, JBoss, OpenStack, Subversion etc. With the additions, in 2013, the program was renamed to the Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program. At one point, there were 16 organizations involved in this program. In 2015, the program was again renamed to Outreachy.",
      "Did I mention Perl in the above discussion?",
      "Well, in 2014, TPF sponsored an internship for Pattawan Kaewduangdee to work on MetaCPAN under the mentorship of Olaf Alders as a part of the Outreach Program for Women. There is another name that caught my eye, Upasana Shukla. I came across <a href=\"https://upasana.me/2013/05/18/meta-cpan-debian-wikimedia-twisted-dancer-moose/\">a blog post</a> by Upasana where she mentioned how GNOME's Outreach Program for Women helped her get into the Perl fold. If you look at the <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2021-05/\">list of interns</a> from the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka) it is amazing. In recent years, TPF has sponsored <a href=\"https://world.openfoodfacts.org\">Open Food Facts</a> projects for Outreachy. In 2020, Areesha Tariq, from Pakistan successfully got the internship to work on the Open Food Facts project. Please check out this <a href=\"https://medium.com/@areeshatariq02/get-a-remote-and-paid-internship-my-outreachy-experience-482a6cfc0564\">blog post</a> by Areesha sharing her experience. It didn't stop there, a few weeks ago, TPF announced another intern, Rosheen Naeem, again from Pakistan, to work on the Open Food Facts project. You should check out her recent <a href=\"https://roshnaeem.medium.com/everybody-struggles-f6dbe33293b4\">blog post</a> about her journey. It is very inspiring.",
      "I would like to thank TPF for supporting the Perl projects and Outreachy.",
      "I can tell you from my own experience, we have great talent in the Indian Subcontinent. I wish more and more organisations would come forward and sponsor interns from these regions. When I started <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge - Perl & Raku</a>, (a.k.a Perl Weekly Challenge), I was hoping to tap into the talent pool from this region, specially young college students. As the tagline says \"You do not have to be an expert\" to take part in the weekly challenge. Although we do have handful of students from Russia in the team. I am glad that, at least, we have built a platform where geeks from around the world come and share their experiences every week. Maybe one day we will have sponsors to help us reach out to young talent and bring new energy into the Perl community. Sometimes I wonder why we have never had a Perl Conference on the Indian subcontinent just like we have here in Europe and America. It shouldn't be too hard to hold one as these days everything is online. We could invite guest speakers from across the globe to address the talent in the region. Is there anyone out there willing to help us orgranise Perl Conference?",
