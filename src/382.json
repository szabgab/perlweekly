      "The next Saturday, 24th Nov 2018, is the London Perl Workshop action day. For the first time, I have seen the preparations so closely, being part of the oragnisers team, how much effort and hard work involved in the preparations. This year also we have lots of very interesting talks and hands-on training session organised. Thanks to all the speakers and sponsors. But for me, the main attraction is going to be the open session <a href=\"http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2018/event/2137\">\"I am a Former London.PM Leader - Ask Me Anything\"</a>. If you are attending the workshop then you wouldn't want to miss the opportunity to ask questions directly to the designated guests. It is going to be hosted by none other than, Katherine Spice.",
      "If you are regular visitor of metacpan.org then you would have noticed a new link \"% Coverage\" on the distribution home page. I think this was done during the recent meta::hack session. I personally like this new addition. It has forced me to address the coverage issue of my personal distributions that I have been avoiding so far. Please do share your views on the same.",
      "Let us talk about <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/zoffix_znet/2018/11/announce-raku-perl-6-diwali-6d-language-specification-release.html\">Raku Perl 6 'Diwali' 6.d Language Specification</a> release. I have been following this discussion on Twitter prior to the release. I was very excited for a very different reason though. Being, an Indian, I was so happy that the Perl 6 team, picked 'Diwali' as 6.d release name. Diwali is one of my favourite festivals. For those, who don't know, it is a festival of lights. Having said that, I hardly get to celebrate ever since I moved to London. I really miss the fun and celebration.",
