      "Hi there,",
      "This week we saw the tremendous and devastating power of nature in Europe as well. The Guardian even mentioned the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/16/western-germany-floods-angela-merkel-horror-catastrophe-deaths-missing-search-flooding-belgium\">Moselle River at Perl in Germany</a>. The place where Liz and Wendy attempted to re-unite the Perl 5 and Perl 6 communities as well. That was not very successful.",
      "I was wondering what can we do?",
      "I know a few members of the Perl community who are also volunteer firefighters. Some of them might have taken part in the rescue efforts maybe even risking their own lives. That a very generous way of helping others and helping the world when disaster strikes.",
      "I know a few other members of the Perl community who make an effort to reduce their own carbon footprint by traveling by bike and train only. That can help postpone the disasters and if enough people do them might even prevent the disasters.",
      "What do you do? What examples could we follow to help when disaster strikes? What could ew do to try to avoid the disasters in the first place? Write about it in a blog and send the link to me!",
      "Enjoy your week!"
