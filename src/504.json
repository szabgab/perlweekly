      "Hi there",
      "I believe there are countless silent supporters of Perl doing great services to bring back Perl to #1. I became an active member of The Perl Community with the release of my first CPAN module, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/Test-Excel\">Test::Excel</a>, in the year 2010. Believe it or not, there are plenty of support out there, if you are interested to contribute to CPAN. I am telling this from my own experience, Dave Cross, recently contributed to one of my favourite distribution, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/Map-Tube\">Map::Tube</a> and offered to help me sort out an outstanding sticky issue. Thank you Dave for your help, much appreciated.",
      "Now a days, you will find plenty of support available on social platform like Facebook and Twitter. I know about 2 very active and vibrant facebook groups Perl centric, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity/\">The Perl Community</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/\">Perl Programmers</a>. Being moderator of both Facebook groups, I can tell you they are very much loved by everyone. If you are interested to become CPAN contributor then please take a look at my article, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor/\">How to become CPAN contributor</a>, my first for Perl.com.",
      "If you are active on social platform, you will notice, Gabor Szabo contributions regularly. I am sure you must have come across, <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/\">Perl Maven</a>, a project run by Gabor for many years now. You can find answer to most of your Perl questions there. Even if you ask Google a perl question, it is more likely you will be directed to Perl Maven for an answer.",
      "I have an appeal to all Perl fans out there to help us remove the negative vibe around Perl. One of the many ways you can help us, is by writing about your own Perl experience and how it helped you on daily basis. You pick and choose the platform you are comfortable with. I have couple of suggestions, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/\">perl.com</a> and <a href=\"https://dev.to/search?q=perl\">dev.to</a>. I would like to mention two names that comes to my mind immediately, <a href=\"https://dev.to/mjgardner\">Mark Gardner</a>, who recently got the 8 Week Streak badge from DEV.to for publishing each week consistently for the past eight weeks. And the second name is <a href=\"https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY/\">Flavio Poletti</a> for writing a blog every day for more than a year without break. They are the real stars in my humble opinion. For regular reader of Perl Weekly newsletter, Flavio is a familiar name as we regularly mention his blogs every week.",
      "I would also like to mention, <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge (a.k.a Perl Weekly Challenge)</a> for contributing 1400+ blogs in the last 2 years discussing about Perl and Raku solutions. Well done Team PWC. Keep contributing and spreading the words.",
