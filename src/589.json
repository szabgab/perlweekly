      "It is still a bit surprising to me that only about 50% of the distributions recently uploaded to CPAN have any CI configured. Look at the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html\">stats</a> and look at the <a href=\"https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/\">detailed report</a>. Clearly we, in the Perl community, have been spoiled by the excellent work of the <a href=\"http://cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers</a> and thus people feel less need to enable GitHub Actions. On the other hand by enabling GitHub Actions they could reduce the load from the (very few) CPAN testers. They could get feedback much faster. In some ways they could do even do more diverse testing.",
      "I just saw the <a href=\"https://github.com/FGasper/perl-github-action-tips\">Tips for testing Perl modules via GitHub</a> of Felipe Gaspar. There are some excellent suggestions on how to test your module on some special versions of perl and on other platforms such as Cygwin, FreeBSD, OpenBSD. Just to name a few. I'd like to also reiterate my offer. If you'd like to get help adding GitHub Actions to your project, open an issue on your GitHub project and tag me (@szabgab) so I'll be notified. I'll be happy to help and maybe even create a <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/os\">blog post and record a video</a> about your module. I keep a <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/ci-for-cpan-modules\">journal</a> of the recent PRs I sent with some comments and links.",
