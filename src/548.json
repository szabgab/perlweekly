      "Hi there",
      "Do you have a Perl books collection?",
      "I am sure most of us own the <strong>Camel</strong> book. As you know, there have been hardly any new <strong>Perl</strong> books published in recent years. I recently bought two very popular <strong>Perl</strong> books <strong>\"Extending and Embedding Perl\"</strong> and <strong>\"Network Programming with Perl\"</strong>. I have realised there are two distinct views about good old <strong>Perl</strong> books. One view is that the recommendations in these books are no longer in use, since we have better choices available on <strong>CPAN</strong> now. I fully agree with this view but I also agree to the other view that it is still relevant in terms of base knowledge of the subject. Above all, there is a sentimental values attached to each <strong>Perl</strong> book that I own.",
      "How about you?",
      "Last week, <strong>Gabor</strong>, spoke about learning languages in his editorial. Being an <strong>Indian</strong> by birth, I know more than just the national language of India, <strong>Hindi</strong>. I can understand, to be precise, <strong>six human languages</strong>. Nowadays, I am learning <strong>Spanish</strong> from my daughter as she is learning as part of her school curriculum. But here I would like to know how many programming languages one can fluently code in. Recently in <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a> contest, we have received loads of solutions in different languages. In <strong>week 147</strong>, we received <strong>100+</strong> solutions. One member who stands out front the crowd is <strong>Abigail</strong>, who has contributed in <strong>30 different programming languages</strong>. To me it seems impossible, but he did it.",
      "How many programming languages do I know? Well thanks to the weekly challenge, I have had the opportunity to code in <strong>Raku</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Swift</strong> as well as <strong>Perl</strong>, of course. Do you want to try some new languages? Please give it a try.",
      "Enjoy the week and stay safe."
