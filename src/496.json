      "I think it is unfair to compare the two, but I couldn't stop myself. Let me make this crystal clear, I am talking about two static site builder. Statocles written in Perl and Hugo written in Go.",
      "Why am I even talking about Hugo in the Perl weekly newsletter?",
      "Well, to me it doesn't matter whether it is Perl or any other language. What matters is which one gets the job done quickly. I hear it is matter of personal choice as well. I was first introduced to <a href=\"https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo\">Hugo</a> when I wrote my <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor/\">first article</a> for <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/\">Perl.com</a> in 2018. If I am not mistaken, they still use Hugo. I was so impressed with Hugo that I used it to build <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge</a> website. During the peak of my CPAN contributions, I came to know about <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Statocles\">Statocles</a>. I loved it but never got the opportunity to use it. However I did become one of the contributors to the project. My contribution wasn't ground-breaking, but I feel proud to see my name in the list of contributors. All credit goes to Doug Bell for the coolest tool. For those who don't know him, he leads the team running and managing the <a href=\"https://cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers</a> since Barbie took a break.",
      "Last week, I saw a new website <a href=\"https://perl.kiwi/\">perl.kiwi</a> become the talk of the town. It is built using Statocles as the idea behind the website is to promote Perl. I am going to keep an eye out for fun stuff related to Perl. I loved the domain name. Congratulations Lance Wicks.",
      "Talking about promoting Perl, Sawyer shared the details of the <a href=\"https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/01/msg258817.html\">3rd Perl Steering Council meeting</a>.

We should all be thankful to the PSC members for their time and efforts.",
      "Last time I forgot to mention about the <a href=\"https://kyzn.org/posts/prc-2020-report/\">Pull Request Club 2020 Report</a> by Kivanc Yazan. Kudos to Kivanc for running the club for 2 years now. Keep it up. You are doing a great service to the Perl community.",
      "Last but not the least, please don't forget to watch the weekly show, \"Perl Town Hall\" by Will Braswell on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers\">Facebook</a>. It doesn't suit my timezone but I do watch it the recordings later.",
