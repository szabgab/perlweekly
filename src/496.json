      "Hi there",
      "I think it is unfair to compare the two but I couldn't stop myself. Let me make this crystal clear, I am talking about two static site builder. Statocles written in Perl and Hugo written in Go.",
      "Why am I even talking about Hugo in the Perl weekly newsletter?",
      "Well, to me it doesn't matter whether it is Perl or any other language. What matters is who gets the job done quickly. I hear it is matter of personal choice as well. I was first introduced to <a href=\"https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo\">Hugo</a> when I wrote my <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-become-cpan-contributor/\">first article</a> in 2018 for <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/\">Perl.com</a>. If I am not mistaken they still use Hugo. I was so impressed with Hugo that I used it to build <a href=\"https://perlweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge</a> website. During the peak of my CPAN contributions, I came to know about Statocles. I loved it but never got the opportunity to use it. However I did become one of the contributors of <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Statocles\">Statocles</a>. Although my contribution wasn't ground breaking but I feel proud to see my name in the list of contributors. All credit goes to Doug Bell for the coolest tool. For those who don't know him, he is leading the team running and managing the <a href=\"https://cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers</a> after Barbie took the break.",
      "Last week, I saw a new website <a href=\"https://perl.kiwi/\">perl.kiwi</a> became talk of the town. It is built using Statocles as idea behind the website is to promote Perl. I am going to keep an eye for fun stuff related to Perl. I loved the domain name. Congratulations Lance Wicks.",
      "Talking about promoting Perl, Sawyer shared the details of <a href=\"https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/01/msg258817.html\">3rd Perl Steering Committee</a> meeting. There is another big annoucement by Sawyer with regard to the release date of <a href=\"https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/01/msg258817.html\">Perl v5.34</a>. We should all be thankful to the PSC members for their time and efforts.",
      "Last but not the least, please don't forget to watch weekly show, \"Perl Town Hall\" by Will Braswell on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers\">Facebook</a>. Although it doesn't suit my timezone but I do watch it later the recordings.",
