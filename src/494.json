     "Hi there",
     "Welcome to my first edition of newsletter of year 2021. I hope you had great start so far.",
     "Today I am going to share my personal experience from back 1999. It was the year when I was first introduced to Perl and joined startup building Perl developers team. In the team, we have 2 newcomers (incuding myself) and 1 senior dev. My first project was a web based app using MySQL as database. I had really hard time to install DBI on my dev box. The senior dev was reluctant to help me. I approached my manager and he told me to build the project against text file for time being. I was given Black & White monitor and expected to build the colorfull web app. Fast forward, the project completed with all the obstacles and it was time to demo. Guess what, I was given color monitor this time. As expected it didn't look professional and embarassed me. However few months later, I found out the help to install DBI.",
     "Why am I sharing this story?",
     "Well last week, a Perl enthusiast from Indonesia contacted me on Twitter having trouble installing <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/Calendar-Hijri\">Calendar::Hijri</a>. I was wondering how did he know about my Twitter account as I didn't share the information in the pod. With little fight, the issue was resolved and he got the colorfull Hijri calendar. It is so satisfactory to be able to help fellow hacker.",
     "Coding in Perl? What support do you need?",
     "The Perl Foundation is running the <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7YCL7JZ\">survey</a>. It is aimed to guide newcomers. There is on going discussion on the subject for you to checkout at <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/comments/ko88ie\">Reddit</a>",
     "Have you come across any Perl myths?",
     "I guess, yes. Someone who used Perl for years must have rebuked Perl myths. I recently came across an article titled <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/perl-myths-pritesh-ugrankar\">Debunking Perl Myths</a> by Pritesh Ugrankar. I feel so happy to see fellow Indian being discussed widely with regard to Perl. I would recommend the article to anyone starting Perl so he/she starts with solid base.",
     "Let me ask you a question, can you list new features released with Perl v5.xx?",
     "I have had to fight for this information during the peak when I was actively contributing to CPAN modules. With time, I built up the notes. I remember Dave Cross gave <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/davorg/modern-perl-catchup\">talk</a> on the similar topic at the London Perl Workshop 2016. I had the honour to be in the room. I still remember, for the first time, I came to know about the special source code token \"__SUB__\" introduced in Perl v5.16. If you are keen to know the detailed discussion of each features with every release then I would recommend the latest creation of brian d foy, titled <a href=\"https://perlschool.com/books/perl-new-features/\">Perl new features v5.10 to v5.32</a>. It is published by Dave Cross's <a href=\"https://perlschool.com/about/\">Perl School</a>. Whatever little I have read so far, it is promising. Every Perl devs should have it handy. Thanks brian d foy for the review copy.",
     "A fellow member of Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/\">Perl Programmers</a> shared the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R00JE6QRbno\">video</a> of struggle of new Perl developer. I enjoyed watching his struggle to get the right answer. I am sure there will be something to learn from his experience.",
     "Are you looking for fresh start in the year 2021?",
     "It is a fact the demand for Perl developers are not as high as it used to be. However there is one guy, Pete Sergeant, who single handedly kept us upto date with every possible opportunities across the globe. Don't forget to checkout the opportunities at the end of the newsletter. Pete is not just a recruiter but he is an experienced Perl hacker. Don't believe me? Please checkout his MetaCPAN <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/author/SARGIE\">profile</a>.",
     "Last but not the least you take care of yourself and your loved ones. Please enjoy rest of the newsletter."
