      "Hi there",
      "Welcome to my first edition of the newsletter for the year 2021. I hope you have had a great start to the year.",
      "Today I am going to share a personal experience from back in 1999. It was the year when I was first introduced to Perl and joined a start-up that was building Perl developerment team. In the team, we had two newcomers (incuding myself) and one senior developer. My first project was a web based app using MySQL as the database. I had really a hard time installing DBI on my development box and the senior dev was reluctant to help me. I approached my manager and he told me to build the project against a text file for time being. I was given a black & white monitor and was expected to build a colourful web app. Eventually, the project was completed despite all the obstacles and it was time to demo it. Guess what? I was given a colour monitor this time. As expected it didn't look professional and it embarassed me. However a few months later, I found out how to install DBI.",
      "Why am I sharing this story?",
      "Well last week, a Perl enthusiast from Indonesia contacted me on Twitter having trouble installing <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/Calendar-Hijri\">Calendar::Hijri</a>. I wondered how he founnd my Twitter account as I don't include thast information in the module's pod. After a little fight, the issue was resolved and he got the colourful Hijri calendar. It is so satisfactory to be able to help a fellow hacker.",
      "Coding in Perl? What support do you need?",
      "The Perl Foundation is running a <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7YCL7JZ\">survey</a>. It is aimed at newcomers to the language. There is a ongoing discussion on the subject for you to check out <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/comments/ko88ie\">on Reddit</a>",
      "Have you come across any Perl myths?",
      "I guess so, yes. Someone who has used Perl for years must have rebuked some Perl myths in that time. I recently came across an article titled <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/perl-myths-pritesh-ugrankar\">Debunking Perl Myths</a> by Pritesh Ugrankar. I feel so happy to see a fellow Indian being discussed widely with regard to Perl. I would recommend the article to anyone starting Perl so he/she starts with solid base.",
      "Let me ask you a question, can you list new features released with Perl v5.xx?",
      "I have had to fight for this information during the peak when I was actively contributing to CPAN modules. With time, I built up a series of notes on this. I remember Dave Cross gave <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/davorg/modern-perl-catchup\">talk</a> on the similar topic at the London Perl Workshop in 2016 and I had the honour to be in the room. I still remember that was the first time I heard about the special source code token \"__SUB__\" introduced in Perl v5.16. If you are keen to read a detailed discussion of the features added with every new release of Perl then I would recommend the latest creation from brian d foy, entitled <a href=\"https://perlschool.com/books/perl-new-features/\">Perl New Features</a>. It is published by Dave Cross's <a href=\"https://perlschool.com/about/\">Perl School</a> and covers releases from 5.10 to 5.32. From the little I have read so far, it looks really promising. Every Perl dev should have a copy handy. Thanks to brian d foy for the review copy.",
      "A fellow member of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/\">Perl Programmers</a> Facebook Group shared a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R00JE6QRbno\">video of a struggling new Perl developer</a>. I enjoyed watching his struggle to get the right answer. I am sure there will be something to learn from his experience.",
      "Are you looking for fresh start in the year 2021?",
      "It is a fact that the demand for Perl developers is not as high as it used to be. However there is one guy, Pete Sergeant, who singlehandedly keeps us up to date with every possible opportunity across the globe. Don't forget to check out the opportunities at the end of the newsletter. Pete is not just a recruiter but he is an experienced Perl hacker. Don't believe me? Please check out his MetaCPAN <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/author/SARGIE\">profile</a>.",
