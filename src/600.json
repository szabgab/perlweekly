You know what I mean and where you can catch us. I love having 2-ways dicussion on any topics related to Perl. It is something I always encourage if you have spare time. I have seen how young blood getting involved in so many exciting things about Perl, for example on <strong>Telegram</strong>.

I have senior member of <strong>Perl Community</strong> helping young blood with their experiences. It would be unfair to name few here. You know who I am talking about. I salute to all those who keep <strong>Perl</strong> alive.",
