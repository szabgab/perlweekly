I also shared my interest in contributing to the <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> project. To my absolute delight, that wish came true the very same day! I received an invitation from the organiser to join the <strong>Perl Toolchain Summit 2025</strong>, happening in <strong>Leipzig, Germany</strong> from May 1st to May 4th 2025. I didn't wait even a second to accept the invitation. It's truly an honour to be part of such a talented group.",
      "In all the excitement, I've already booked my flight ticket to <strong>Berlin</strong> and from there I'll hop on a fast train to <strong>Leipzig</strong>. The last time, I visited Germany was back in <strong>2018</strong> when I attended the <strong>20th German Perl Workshop</strong> in the city of <strong>Gummersbach</strong>. I even gave couple of talks and one of them being <strong>\"Introduction to Map::Tube\"</strong>. After the event, I even shared my experience in this <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2018/04/20th-german-perl-workshop---report.html\">event report</a>.",
