      "I have been asked this question many times. And I always find it hard to answer. Recently I came across a post on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/\">Facebook</a> which started the discussion once again. I am pleasantly surprised by some of the response to this question.",

I have yet to try it myself, but I am certainly going to get my hands dirty soon. If you are a CPAN module author then please give it a go and share your experience with us. Let's make this as popular as CPAN itself.",
      "On a similar note, Gabor Szabo, started the <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/cpan-digger\">CPAN Digger</a> project. I remember many years ago, Gabor shared the idea with me and wanted me to work on this. Unfortunately I never got around to it. I am so happy that it is finally arrived. It would be great if we all come along and help with the project.",
      "A recent <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/samir_parikh/2020/11/perl-podcasts.html\">post</a> by Samir Parikh, brought up the topic of \"Perl Podcasts\" once again. I still remember Lance Wicks and I discussed the subject during the Perl Conference in Glasgow in 2018. We even recorded our first interview together with a very popular face in the Perl commnunity. What a shame I couldn't give the attention it needed. I am still hopeful one day we will get it back in action.",
