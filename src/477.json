Unfortunately with time all the contributors moved to other projects and some of them to other programming languages. Now the project is dormant.",

The second goal is to create a set of <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/tk\">Perl Tk examples and videos</a> explaining it to make it easier to you too to create Perl Tk based GUIs.",
