You can buy it both on Amazon and on Leanpub. Leanpub gives you the option to change the price so you can also use this opportunity to give a one-time donation to him. As far as I know, Leanpub also gives a much bigger part of the price to the author than Amazon does. You can also ask them to send the book to your Kindle or you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle\">upload it yourself</a>. I already bought it and started to read it. Now you go, <a href=\"https://perlschool.com/books/design-patterns/\">buy the book!</a>",
