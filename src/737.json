      "There is a new episode of Underbar, the Perlish podcast, part 3 of the Vibe-coding with Perl series came out, and there is an article whether one should learn Perl in 2025.",
      "Regarding that. My son became a programmer a while ago mostly writing in Python and some fron-end stuff when necessary. He also knows how to use vim and he is definitely not lost on the Linux command-line. I don't think there is a lot of value for him to learn Perl in general, but being able to write one-liner to help with various small tasks could be really usefule. So I started to put together a bunch of oneliners in Perl and converted it into a book. It is still only in its infancy, but to go with the tradition I decided to release early.",
      "Thus you can already <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/oneliners/\">read it for free</a> or if you'd like to also support my efforts then you can buy an epub/pdf version of it via <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/oneliners/\">Leanpub</a>. You can even pick the price.",
