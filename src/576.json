If you are interested to know more then please do checkout this <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki\">page</a> maintained by <strong>Curtis Poe</strong>.",
      "<a href=\"https://metacpan.org/recent\">MetaCPAN</a> is another place where you can see all the latest cool <strong>Perl</strong> projects. I know plenty of volunteers helping to improve the code base.
