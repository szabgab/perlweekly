      "Hi there",
      "I recently came across a <a href=\"https://davecross.substack.com/p/the-story-of-ebooks-and-me\">blog post</a> by Dave Cross where he shared the story of how he got into publishing ebooks. I highly recommend you read his blog post, I find it inspirational, personally. I always wanted to write a technical book on a subject related to Perl. I have high regard for those who are professional authors e.g. Curtis Poe, brian d foy, Gabor Szabo, Dave Cross and many more. Ever since I started the weekly challenge, I became more involved in writing technical blogs. Soon I realised it is not the same as writing a technical book. But the urge inside me to become an author didn't die forever. With Dave's recent blog post fanning the idea once again, I became charged one more time but this time I am seriously thinking about it. I have a topic that I wanted to explore for some time. I discussed it with Gabor and Dave and got very positive responses. So it is official I am now working on my first book, soon to be published by Dave Cross. Fingers crossed. Life is so beautiful when you have friends like Gabor and Dave who always encourage and guide you.",
      "There is another story that I would like to share. Andrew Shitov reached out to me few days ago to ask if I was interested in sharing my Raku story at the upcoming <a href=\"https://conf.raku.org/\">The Raku Conference</a>. I have accepted his offer and am working on my presentation. I haven't submitted my talk yet but will do so soon. Do you have a Raku story to share? If yes, then please do submit your talk before the deadline.",
      "One last story for the week and then I will go away. Many of you know that I have been running the Perl Weekly Challenge for more than 2 years now. It started as a weekly challenge aimed for Perl and Raku community but soon it spread out to other languages. As of today, we now have received contributions in over 50 different languages. Latest addition is the <a href=\"https://code-maven.com/crystal-binary-palindrom\">Crystal programming language</a> by none other than Gabor Szabo himself. A long time ago, someone (I don't remember who), suggested that I should register a generic domain instead of perlweeklychallenge.org. I didn't waste any time and registered the new domain theweeklychallenge.org. Having registered the new domain, I didn't have the courage and expertise to switch over the actively used live site to another domain. I asked about this on Facebook and guess what? Dave Cross came up with step-by-step guide explaining how to do the domain switch. I was still very nervous to take the risk. Then came the final blow with Gabor asking the same question: why don't I move domain to a generic domain. To cut a long story short, Gabor and I spent an hour or so yesterday (Sunday afternoon) and got the domain switched over. So we now have new domain the weekly challenge: <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">theweeklychallenge.org</a>. Thank you Gabor and Dave for all the support and guidance.",
