      "The highlight of this week was the discussion around CPAN. What are the problems with it and what are the possible solutions. This is not a new topic. It has was raised several times and some progress was made. For example MetaCPAN born out from similar discussions and it is a huge step toward improving the situation if not solving the problem. This is a very visible project with a very modern stack. Worth looking into it.",
      "The other discussion that was especially interesting to me was the one that David Golden posted about. How do you see the future of Perl? Would you accept some backward compatibility breaks in Perl in other to gain some new features? What do you think about Perl 6? Does that frame how you think about Perl 5 or is that the other way around?",
