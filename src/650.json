      "We had a big release <strong>Perl v5.38</strong> last year, <strong>July 3, 2023</strong>. It was the first release introducing <strong>Corinna</strong> into core. Although it was good enough for starter but I am looking for another push in the next release in the year 2024. I am sure you must have tried the new OO in core. One thing that I really wanted was the ability to create a <strong>role</strong> using new shiny OO. I have no idea what is in the plan for the next release. I am looking forward to another update to the new OO ecosystem.",
      "Personally, I am also looking forward to the next <strong>Perl and Raku Conference in Las Vegas</strong>. I had a wonderful experience last year in <strong>Canada</strong>. I hope things get back to normal before the event. I don't know about the conference in Europe. I missed it last year as it clashed with my India visit. It used to be my only opportunity to meet fellow <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> friends. I miss the local event, <strong>London Perl Workshop</strong>. I hope it gets fresh boost this year.",
      "My pet project, <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a> recently completed <strong>250 weeks</strong>. It has been a great learning experience for me personally. I was introduced to <strong>Raku</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. Thanks to the team members we get regular blog posts talking about magical <strong>Perl</strong> code. Talking about blog post, <strong>Olaf Alders</strong>, invites us to join the <a href=\"https://wundersolutions-com.eo.page/k22w4\">newsletter</a>. I have accepted his invitation. How about you?",
