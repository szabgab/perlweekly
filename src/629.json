      "Hi there,",
      "Once in a while when I share something that is not Perl related I get some negative comments. Occasionally even some hate-speech or abusive messages. It's not pleasant, but I hear from others who publish stuff, that they get such messages too. In some cases a lot more than I do. So I guess it is part of the deal. I might have some more impact on the life of people by having this platform and some people hate me for that. The question, what shall I do with my 'platform'?",
      "Some people think the Perl Weekly and even me as an individual should only care about Perl. They say: If people see that the chief editor of the Perl Weekly talks about other programming languages then that's going to ruin Perl. It's pretty laughable as most of the other weekly newsletters are owned by a single person who runs them as a business.",
      "Anyway, I recall in the early 2000s we had a very active Perl Mongers group in Israel called <a href=\"https://perl.org.il/\">Israel.pm</a> that I lead. At one point we started to have a 'foreign languages' track in which we showed each other various other programming languages. I recall once I gave a presentation about Dart. We also had presentations about Tcl, Ruby, and Python. We were not bothered by that. At one point I even started to joke that in Perl There's More Than One Way To Do It, one of them is Python.",
      "Unfortunately I did not pick up Python early enough and did not start to offer Python training early enough. As most of my clients started to switch to Python they found other trainers who offered Python courses. By the time I realized I need to diversify it was too late. Most of my clients were gone and getting back them is rather difficult as they already have a trainer they are satisfied with.",
      "Which brings me to a question I ask myself: Should the Perl Weekly be exclusively about Perl serving the interest of the language, or should it serve the interest of the people on the newsletter? I think we need to strike a balance. Mostly providing Perl-related content, but also provide some pointers for people who understand that they too might need to look elsewhere in order to find a source of income.
