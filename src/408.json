      "Taking the clue from last week <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/407.html\">editorial</a> by Gabor, it made me think are those, who are in job, being paid adequately? I came across a <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/articles/the-worst-job-offer.html\">post</a> few days ago by Curtis \"Ovid\" Poe. It reminded me of an instance, few years ago, a very big Perl house in Central London exploiting Perl developers. It turned out Curtis had similar encounter with the same company. If it is happening in the city like London, you can imagine the exploitation in the smaller city. I know there are not many Perl developer roles in the city but should that be an excuse not to pay adequately?",
      "A very close friend of mine, an exceptional Perl developer, started exploring Dev Ops role recently. I think it makes sense and natural transition for any Perl developers. Some even adopted Go lang as well, which is completely in a different zone. I wonder when are we going to see Perl6 role being advertised. Is it not ready and stable enough yet for production code? I have noticed it made lots of positive noise recently.",
      "At last, I realised that I have completed one year as an assistant editor of PerlWeekly newsletter. On 21st May 2018, I edited my first <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/356.html\">PerlWeekly</a> newsletter. It has been wonderful experience so far for me. I would like to thank Chief Editor Gabor Szabo for the guidance and moral support.",
      "Enjoy and have fun reading the newsletter."
