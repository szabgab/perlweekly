      "Most of this issue was put together by Yanick, (thanks man!), I only added a few entries and this opening. - I have been waiting for the announcement and I am glad it is out. There are going to be a number of training classes before and after YAPC::NA in the beginning of June. I am responsible for two of the classes. I hope to see many of the Perl Weekly readers at the conference and maybe even in the course.",
