The venue is not too far from where I live (London), yet I have never attended. In fact, I have never been to <strong>FOSDEM</strong> though every year I plan to attend and end up missing it.",

Being human, we are never satisfied and always want more. It is easy to demand more but very hard to give time and energy.",
