My favourite line in the post, <strong>\"I think there’s a good case to be made that OOP is not nearly as useful as it’s claimed.\"</strong>. Mind you, this is coming from <strong>Curtis</strong>.",
      "Enough of OO, lets talk about <strong>Exceptions in Perl</strong>, I would like to share the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Ovid/5205534f7dcc52e4d931aaff301b39aa\">blog post</a> by <strong>Curtis</strong> (once again), where he points out the common issue in Perl. It reminded me about my recent <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v534/try-catch.pl\">post</a> sharing the new try/catch block in <strong>Perl v5.34</strong>.",
      "Last but not the least, please find this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Ovid/0ef90f9f48f04fdad5d2ee8204fab776\">gem</a> by <strong>Curtis</strong> talking about testing database operations with a fresh instance of SQLite everytime. I wonder, if this can be shared as <strong>CPAN module</strong>. Just thinking out loud, I know.",
