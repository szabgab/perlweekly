There was no response (maybe because it is so hard to comment in the current bpo), but I don't think that should stop anyone from starting their own blog somewhere else. GitHub pages is a great and free way to write blog posts and Disqus can be used as a commenting engine or one could just link to a Reddit post where others could comment.

But actually why use those? Isn't the correctness of the code more important? I think if someone starts with those two, they will soon enforce running the whole test suite before every commit or before every push. This will make people hate committing and they will do it much less frequently. Which contradicts the whole idea of Continuous Integration and reduces cooperation. Of course if one does it to himself/herself that is their choice.",
