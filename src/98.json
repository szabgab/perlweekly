For those not fortunate enough to have been present, a plethora of videos and slidedecks are now flooding YouTube and the various blogs -- hunt these down in the 'Slides and Videos' section.  Beside those talk links, this week has been fairly quiet, a side-effect of having a huge portion of the Perl community being busy having a jolly good time. However, fear not: we can safely expect blogging volumes to return to normal next week, as hackers slowly trickle back to their keyboards. ~Yanick"
