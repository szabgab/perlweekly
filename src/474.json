      "To me, Docker, is a tool for DevOps. Having said that I have seen many fellow devs also played with it. At my work place also, we also have Docker-based QA environment. I must admit I have yet to get to the bottom of it. I remember last year, Dave Cross, did 4-part <a href=\"https://dev.to/davorg/series/892\">Into the Cloud Series</a>. It was my first informal introduction to Docker. Talking about Docker, I would also like to share, a recent <a href=\"https://code-maven.com/raku-first-steps\">blog</a> by Gabor Szabo, touching the Docker base.",
