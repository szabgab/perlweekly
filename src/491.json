      "Two weeks ago it was announced that <a href=\"https://log.perl.org/2020/12/rtcpanorg-sunset.html\">rt.cpan.org will sunset on March 1st, 2021</a>. I recorded a <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/rt-cpan-org-is-closing\">video</a> about it. There was a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/k73bxy/rtcpanorg_is_closing/\">Reddit discussion</a> about it with a few inappropriate comments. Then Dave Cross wrote an <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2020/12/rt-action-plan-for-cpan-authors/\">Action Plan for CPAN Authors</a> and got some useful <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/k7tcgp/rt_action_plan_for_cpan_authors_perl_hacks/\">comments</a>. I am personally disappointed that no discussion, or public call for help preceded this decision, but I think moving to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket issues can benefit the projects. Later Dave Cross came up with an interesting solution. Using <a href=\"https://perlhacks.com/2020/12/replacing-cpan-rt/\">gitpan to replace CPAN RT</a>.",
