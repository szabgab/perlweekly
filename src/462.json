      "Hi there",
      "In the last week <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/461.html\">edition</a> of Perl Weekly newsletter, the Editor-in-Chief Gabor Szabo mentioned about the fun project I am currently working on. I thought I should give an update with regard to the launch date. It is now planned to officially launch on 15th June 2020. It would also coincide with the Perl Weekly edition that I would prepare. The plan is to give the Perl community reason to be proud of. The bottom line is Perl is not going anywhere, it is going to stay and stay stronger. So please watch this space.",
      "Talking about Perl, it would be nice to remind all of us about the \"Cor\", the project currently being worked on by the trio (Stevan Little, Sawyer X and Curtis Poe). It feels nice to see it is making good progress. Thanks to Curtis, we all get regular updates. The motto of this project is \"Good enough\" is not good enough. Please checkout the <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki\">wiki page</a> for more information.",
      "Do you like watching YouTube videos? I do sometimes. Gabor has compiled cool collections of Perl related vidoes for us, called <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/youtube\">Perl on YouTube</a>. Please go and watch the videos when you have free time. Also don't forget to like and follow the channels you like.",
      "Enjoy reading the rest of the newsletter. Stay safe and stay indoor."
