      "Recently there have been discussion about naming Perl 6 language. I remeber during the Perl conference in Riga, one suggestion was to call it Camelia. If you ask my opinion, I am neutral. No matter what you call it, I would still love it and if time permits, I would use it as well. I know the subject is sensitive and hope it gets resolved soon.",
      "On the similar note, there was another track that is very hot these days, is renaming Perl workshop. Recently concluded Swiss Perl Workshop, people sat together and discussed the matter in great details. Not sure the outcome, to be honest. May it would need few more such rounds of discussion. Even London Perl Workshop organisers had discussion on the similar line. As I said earlier, I am neutral to the naming discussion. I just want to get this over and we all move on to more important topics.",
