      "A long long time ago, when I was in high school, I participated in the annual competition of <a href=\"https://www.komal.hu/\">KöMaL, the Mathematical and Physical Journal for High Schools</a>. (Look for the little UK flag for the English version). Back then we sent in the solution by snail-mail and we only had to write our name to be identified. However people with very common names were asked to include a 3-digit number between their names. There was no verification that two people with the exact same name did not pick the same number, but the chances were slim. Because my name is way too common in Hungary I picked the number 529 because it is 23^2. Funnily, if you squint it also resembles the initials of my name: SzG",
