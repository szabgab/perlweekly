      "last week Mohammad expressed his optimism about Perl rising again. It's nice to have a gut feeling about that, but I would also like to see the numbers. So I looked at the stats I've been collecting for a while: The number of <a href=\"https://szabgab.com/cpan-number-of-visits.html\">visits to CPAN</a>. More specifically these are the number of \"entrances\" to MetaCPAN (and in earlier times to SCO as well.) as measured by Google Analytics.",
      "My assumption is that we can measure well the level of Perl usage by the number of visits to <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/\">MetaCPAN</a>.",
      "The number for July 2022 does not indicate any (positive) changes, but it is probably too early to see any effects anyway.",
      "However, looking at the numbers I noticed that there was a nice increase in the activity in 2012. Actually starting in August 2011. This increased activity lasted about a year then the decline continued and by 2014 the activity was below that of the 2011 level.",
