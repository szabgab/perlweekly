      "Hi there",
      "Last week, Gabor Szabo, the Chief Editor of PerlWeekly newsletter started the campaign to involve readers and asked what they want to read in the future newsletter. Taking a clue from it, I came up with the idea of \"Perl Weekly Challenge\". I am certain this is not the first time anyone tried it. Still I want to revive it primarily to engage the Perl enthusiasts. It can be Perl5 or Perl6. My first target is to setup a team who are interested in the weekly challenge. Then we will throw some random challenge to public and see how many different results we get back. We can then pick one as winner, put it on \"Hall of Fame\". We could encourage the winner to share the answer to the challenge as a small blog.",
      "I wrote a <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2019/02/perl-weekly-challenge.html\">blog</a> about it last week. I already had an email the very same day by a perl lover, interested in the challenge. I am looking for more people to join the challenge before we go live.",
      "Last but not the least, please do share what you would want to read."
