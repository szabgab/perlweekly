After enduring recurring <strong>503</strong> outages that jeopardized service for <strong>Perl</strong> hackers worldwide, the <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> team embarked on a disciplined, data-driven counterattack. What began with rudimentary <strong>logs</strong>, <strong>robots.txt</strong> tweaks and manual <strong>IP</strong> bans evolved into a robust partnership with <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com\">Datadog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastly.com\">Fastly</a>, enabling real-time visibility and proactive defense. With the deployment of sophisticated <strong>rate-limiting</strong> rules, <strong>user-agent</strong> filtering, next-generation <strong>WAF</strong> protections and a dynamic challenge system, <strong>MetaCPAN</strong> has successfully blocked some <strong>80 percent</strong> of malicious traffic-including <strong>AI</strong> scrapers-while delivering a steady, reliable experience to legitimate users. This journey highlights how transparency, layered defense and smart automation can transform a crisis into an opportunity for stronger, more sustainable service.",
