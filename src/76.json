      "Hi,",
      "Welcome to 2013! Let's start this year with a new Perl Monger group in Germany meeting on the 9th January and the annual Perl Oasis conference in Orlando, Florida that will be held between 11-13 January.",
      "In another note, as Yanick is getting more involved in the creation of the Perl Weekly, I (Gabor) might need to start changing the way I write. For example should I start referring to myself in the third person? Or maybe we should each make it clear who is talking in the comments. The latter option sounds more personal. For now, I'll add this sig. to some of the entries. What do you think? ~ Gabor"
