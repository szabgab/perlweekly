     "Hi there",
     "The highlight of last week is the Conference in the Cloud. It gave us the opportunities to meet and greet Perl/Raku fans across the globe. On top of that, we got loads of quality talks by the experts. Before I talk about anything else, let me thank and congratulate all the organisers and volunteers for such a successfull event. I am personally impressed with the video quality of the live and recorded talks.",
     "For me, I find the timing little bit odd as in British Summer Time. The day started at 6:30pm UK Time, which is not ideal. At the end of all day $work, there is hardly any energy left to attend the talk live. But the best part was there is recorded talk available on YouTube immediately. I find it convenient as I can watch at my own time. Also I can fastforward if I want to.",
