      "The highlight of last week was the Conference in the Cloud. It gave us the opportunity to meet and greet Perl and Raku fans from across the globe. On top of that, we got loads of quality talks by experts. Before I talk about anything else, let me thank and congratulate all the organisers and volunteers for such a successful event. I am personally impressed with the video quality of the live and recorded talks.",
      "For me, I find the timing little bit odd as I am in the UK. The day started at 6:30pm British Summer Time, which is not ideal. At the end of a full day at $work, there is hardly any energy left to attend the talks live. But the best part wasthat the recorded talks were available on YouTube immediately. I find it convenient, as I can watch at my own time. Also I can fast-forward if I want to.",
