      "Only recently we had a big bang release of <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>  with experimental <strong>class feature</strong>. Now in a quick succession we have another release <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/SHAY/perl-5.39.1/view/pod/perldelta.pod\">Perl v5.39.1</a>. Thanks to the entire team responsible for the release. These heroes work behind the scene for days/months for the improvement of the language. Yet, I rarely see anyone giving them credit on public platform. We should not just mention them in the pod but instead celebrate each one of them more on various public platforms. Having said, we need volunteer for the job. Do we have volunteer for the task?",
      "Few days ago, I had an email from someone senior with lots of experience with <strong>Perl</strong> saying \"2023 is the year the language died for him\". I wonder how can someone just gave up on the language you loved all your life. For me personally, <strong>Perl</strong> will remain my core strength and I will continue to improve my knowledge with every release. It is OK if you learn some new languages to be in the job market but please keep <strong>Perl</strong> your first choice.",
      "Yesterday, when I was done with <strong>Asia Cup 2023</strong> final cricket match between <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, I watched this documentary, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Hack\">The Great Hack</a>, on Netflix. It reminded me data is the new oil now a days. <strong>Perl</strong> is known to be good at data processing, so why are we behind others in this field?",
      "By the way, <strong>India</strong> won the final for the <strong>8th time</strong>. I am so proud of <strong>Team India</strong>. I am now looking forward to the <strong>World Cup 2023</strong> to be held in few months time in <strong>India</strong>.",
