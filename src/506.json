      "One topic that rarely talked about with reference to Perl is \"Memory Management\". Could it be that, being a developer, you don't need to worry about it? Possibly yes as Perl garbage collection is very efficient. However you still have to take care of circular data structure manually. To get to the bottom of the matter, one has to be aware of two things, \"ref count\" and \"weak ref\". Can CPAN help me with it? Yes, there is a module <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Peek\">Devel::Peek</a> available on CPAN. You can figure out about the \"ref count\". How about \"weak ref\" now? Well, again CPAN is handy, you have <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Scalar::Util\">Scalar::Util</a> readily available on CPAN, which provides subroutine weaken() to create \"weak ref\". What is the point of creating \"weak ref\"? Well, in Perl, the \"weak ref\" doesn't affect the \"ref count\" and in a way helps you stop memory leak. I have yet to come across simple working example to demonstrate this behaviour. However, you might find the two recipes <a href=\"https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl4/cook/ch11_16.htm\">11.15</a> and <a href=\"https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl4/cook/ch13_14.htm\">13.13</a> from the good old friend, \"Perl Cookbook, second edition\" very useful. There is another post, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/the-trouble-with-reference-counting\">The Trouble with Reference Counting</a> by David Farrell is also very interesting.",
