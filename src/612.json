Post <strong>9/11</strong>, travelling to <strong>America</strong> having <strong>Mohammad</strong> as first name isn't good idea. Having seen the list of <a href=\"https://tprc2023.sched.com/directory/speakers\">speakers</a>, I am sure it's going to be lots of fun. I really wanted to attend the event and meet the top guns. So what's stopping me? I haven't been keeping well in the recent months. I know my current employer, <a href=\"https://www.oleeo.com\">Oleeo</a> has been regular sponsor of <strong>London Perl Workshop</strong> and have sponsored selected few to attend various events in the past. Having said, I have to be mentally prepared before I take the plunge but I really don't want to miss the opportunity. I still remember the first time, I attended the talk by <strong>Curtis</strong> was at <strong>German Perl Workshop 2018</strong> and it was about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c8ixLgpxwo\">Rescuing Legacy Code</a>. After that I met him again at <strong>The Perl Conference 2019, Riga</strong>. I think that was the last time I ever attended any conference in person. I am not sure if I still have time to reserve a place or even submit a short talk proposal at <strong>The Perl and Raku Conference 2023</strong>.",
      "Talking about conference, I would also like to mention another big event in Europe, <a href=\"https://perlkohacon.fi\">The Perl and Koha Conference in Helsinki</a>. They have extended time to accept talks. So if you are planning to attend then please do submit your proposal now. I am planning to visit India in the month of August otherwise I would have given a push.",
      "I am a big fan of writing skills of <strong>brian d foy</strong>, <strong>Curtis Poe</strong>, <strong>Damian Conway</strong>, <strong>Dave Cross</strong> and many more. It's not just about blog post but also about their books. <strong>Dave Cross</strong> recently published <a href=\"https://actions.davecross.co.uk/\">GitHub Actions Essentials</a>. I haven't read it yet but I am confident it is going to be worth spending time and money.",
