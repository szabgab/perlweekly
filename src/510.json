      "I am not sure if you have read the recent <a href=\"http://neilb.org/2021/04/27/perl-communities.html\">blog post</a> by Neil Bowers. I have read it multiple times to understand the subject of the post. I must admit, I had never read such an in depth analysis of the term \"Community\". As my vocabulary is rather limited, I found it very interesting to read such a long blog post. To me, community is group of like-minded people. When I attended my first London Perl Workshop, I immediately felt part of the community. The organiser and everybody was so accommodating and friendly. It made me come again the following year and I became addicted to it afterwards. I always looked up to the big names of the community everytime I needed some inspiration. Take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel/\">past recipients</a> of the White Camel Award, you can get some idea of who's who in the community. Unfortunately it hasn't been awarded since 2018 for some reason that I am not aware of. I miss the community spirit of attending Perl Conferences. You can never experience that feeling unless you attend one. I hope and wish we get back to attending conferences. Although there has been virtual events in recent times, it can't replace real events in my humble opinion. I must give credit to everyone who is keeping the community spirit alive.",
