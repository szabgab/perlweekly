      "I recently became active on official Slack for <strong>The Perl Foundation</strong> after a long gap. I noticed it is very much active and live. Lots of positive noise and useful information shared with each other. I am not a big fan of Slack but after spending just few days, I find it easy to move around. I would like to keep an eye for important news and announcement. Earlier my only source of information was the good old <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org\">https://blogs.perl.org</a>. We used to have regular post by <strong>Perl</strong> enthusiasts but that has stopped unfortunately. And I don't blame them as I also stopped blogging completely. As and when I do blog, I use <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs\">The Weekly Challenge</a> platform. Having said, the platform is still used by some, for example <strong>Perl Steering Council</strong> for weekly updates. Every now and then, you do get some magical post by <strong>Perl</strong> fans. One such post, <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/e_choroba/2024/03/changes-in-mooxroleparameterized.html\">Changes in MooX::Role::Parameterized</a> appeared last week by <strong>E. Choroba</strong>. I have been a big fan of <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo\">Moo - Minimalist Object Orientation</a>, so this post became even more important for me. Although, <strong>Corinna</strong> has made it to the <strong>Perl</strong> core, it is still a long way before it becomes a complete solution to all OO needs. I am looking forward to the next big release which would bring in some more features, hopefully.",

It used to be regular every month with full of fun facts about new <strong>CPAN</strong> modules released. During those days, I used to be active on CPAN and released few <strong>CPAN</strong>. I had the honour to find place in the post often. Recently <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> took the initiative to revive the activities on <strong>perl.com</strong>. Because of his hard work and with the help of <strong>Mathew Korica</strong> we now have the post series back.
