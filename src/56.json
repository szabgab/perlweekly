If you look at the main graphs, they will seem to be more or less staying at the same level in recent years. If you take in account that some of the lists that are growing are the automatically generated e-mails (e.g. build reports) then you will see the human participation is dropping. Both on the Perl and Python mailing list. More work is needed on this, and on other analyzis, but I think this is beautiful.",
