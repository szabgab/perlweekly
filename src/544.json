I am wondering if anyone other than the creator picked the language in the first year that it existed. If you know their name then please do share it with us. I am sure there must be a handful of people that I am not aware of.",
      "Talking about birthday celebrations, I would like to wish belated Happy Birthday to the mother of our chief editor, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>. As per the record, my birthday was last Monday i.e. <strong>20th December</strong>. To date, I have never celebrated my birthday, this year also went without celebration.",
      "I noticed that I am getting close to my <strong>100th edition</strong> of the newsletter. This is my <strong>94th edition</strong>. It would be a big achievement for me, personally, to reach that number. I am looking forward to the <strong>556th edition</strong> of the weekly newsletter as that will be my <strong>100th edition</strong>.",
