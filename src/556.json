      "How do you test a <strong>Web API</strong> using Perl?",
      "I am sure you have most likely used TDD to test your Web API. How about trying something new for a change?",
      "Something like BDD, Behaviour Driven Development. I came across BDD many years ago when my manager introduced the term to the team and gave us a short tutorial using Java. I was completely blown away by the idea itself. I never actually got the opportunity to use BDD in any of the Perl projects I worked in afterwards, unfortunately. Then few years later in 2018, I got the opportunity to attend the talk <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2018/talk/7547\">Behaviour Driven Development and Cucumber</a> by <strong>Martin Berends</strong> at the London Perl Workshop. After a quick search, I found a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6IsKr50wAE\">video</a> of the same talk. If you missed the talk then it is your chance now to watch the talk. If the video is not enough and you are looking for more. I would highly recommend the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B084Z6GTKK\">Cucumber & Perl</a> by <strong>John Davies</strong>. It was published by <a href=\"https://perlschool.com\">Perl School</a> publishing house run by <strong>Dave Cross</strong>. If you are interested in complete tutorial then you should check out this <a href=\"https://www.cognizantsoftvision.com/blog/how-to-test-web-apis-with-perl-and-cucumber\">blog post</a>.",
      "Speaking of BDD, I came across the term \"<strong>Extreme Programming (XP)</strong>\". TDD has been part of my day job most of the time without realising it being part of XP. I found this <a href=\"https://www.extremeperl.org/bk/home\">website</a> showing <strong>Extreme Programming using Perl</strong>. You can download the entire book in <a href=\"https://www.extremeperl.org/f/extremeperl.pdf\">pdf format</a> for FREE. If you are new to <strong>Extreme Programming</strong> then take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org\">gentle introduction</a>.",
      "THe last couple of years have been very tough for most of us in the IT sector. Although we all have been adjusted to the new normal of work-from-home culture, it has still left some scars behind. Mental health is one such issue being discussed more frequently during this period. I have found a way to keep my mind busy when needed; reading books (mostly non-technical). Recently I found the quote <strong>\"Lately my peace has been more important than proving my point.\"</strong> on web that express my current mental state. How do you deal with your WFH blues?",
      "Last but not least, I have finally reached the 3 digits figure i.e. my <strong>100th edition</strong> of the weekly newsletter. It took me nearly <strong>3 years</strong> to get this far. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every readers of the weekly newsletter for the kind words and appreciations. I would also like to thank, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> for being my guide and mentor, all these years.",
