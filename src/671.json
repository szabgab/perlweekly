If things go well I'll run workshops for 3 languages: Perl, Python, and Rust and several related technologies. I've already schedule several events for Rust and Python and now, to plan ahead, I scheduled another Perl event:",

I am also going to send out (again) a survey to understand better what topics are more interesting to the members of that group and at what time would it be most convenient for them. So by registering and voting for Perl you could get more Perl-related events.",

Are there other in-person or virtual Perl conferences, workshops, or meeting planned? Let us know so we can include them in the Perl Weekly!
