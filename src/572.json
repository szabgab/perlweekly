It would be open to public to submit blog post as <strong>Markdown</strong> formatted page as pull request. After a quick review, the post would be live.",

It has the same the process as I mentioned above, I was reminded the same in response to my <strong>Twitter post</strong> by a friend of mine. It makes me sad to see that the last post on the site was published on <strong>25th May 2021</strong>. I came to know about the site for the first time when I found out about the monthly post <strong>\"What's new on CPAN\"</strong> by <strong>David Farrell</strong>. In the early days of my <strong>CPAN</strong> association, every time I upload a new distribution, I would wait for the article to see if my distribution made it or not. Some of my distributions did appear in the article, just for record. I even did interview series, <strong>The Perl Ambassador</strong> for the site in the year 2020. I had the honour to interview, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-gabor-szabo\">Gabor Szabo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-curtis-poe\">Curtis 'Ovid' Poe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-damian-conway\">Damian Conway</a>. What a shame, I couldn't continue even though I had the list of high profile <strong>Perl Ambassadors</strong> to interview.",
      "I have mostly blogged on <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar\">blogs.perl.org</a>. I don't consider myself an active blogger, although I used to blog frequently before. I don't feel comfortable now a days blogging on <strong>bpo</strong>, so I decided to blog on <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs\">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> and cross linked on <strong>bpo</strong>. It is (cross linking) something not approved by many as I understand. I am likely to setup my personal blog site instead, just for <strong>Perl</strong>. I will share the details when it is live. You are all welcome to contribute.",
      "I am up for new ideas and suggestions too. Please do share if you have one.",
      "Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
