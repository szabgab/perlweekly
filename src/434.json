      "As you all aware Perl6 is now officially renamed as Raku. Ever since, I noticed lots of work are being done to update the official documentation. Also the weekly newsletter of Perl6 is now moved to another <a href=\"https://rakudoweekly.blog/\">domain</a> with new look and feel. I follow it very closely. If you are Raku fan and wants to know what is happening in the world of Raku then this is the one-stop attraction for you.",
      "Similary, PerlWeekly newsletter made an effort to recognise the change in name. We now have a dedicated section just for Raku. So for all Perl fan looking for Raku related news, can still get right here.",
      "<a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/\">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> started work on renaming Perl6. I hope to get it done completely by end of December 2019. Having said that, members are free to send in Raku solution even today. I noticed members using new name in the weekly blog as well.",
      "What else? I also noticed Curtis, joined hands with Sawyer and Steven, to begin the work on Modern OO for core Perl. There have been couple of blogs with regard to the progress of the project i.e. <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2019/10/cor---a-proposal-for-core-perl-oo.html\">Part One</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2019/10/cor---background-core-perl-oo.html\">Part Two</a>.",
      "In my humble opinion, we as community, are doing all we could to be respectful to each other's opinion. Having said that there is always scope of improvement. Lets bring the Perl and Raku community together under one roof in a friendly environment to share each other's idea. Perl Weekly Challenge is providing one such platform where Perl and Raku experts share their knowledge. There have been instances recently where someone who have been doing Perl only challenges, started taking Raku challenges as well. Similary Raku experts doing Perl challenge on and off. This is one of the biggest achievements, in my humble opinion.",
      "Please share your ideas with us. I wish you a great week ahead and enjoy the newsletter."
