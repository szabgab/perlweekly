      "brian d foy is running an fund-raiser on behalf of Jeffrey Thalhammer (author of Perl::Critic and Pinto) to improve Pinto. I believe that the greater Perl community - including all the readers of the Perl Weekly and a lot of other people who don't (yet) read it can start putting some money together for such project. Even if each person only gave $5 or $10, that will quickly tilt the project.",
      "My question: do you think that allowing certain people to work on open source projects (in this case Jeff), can help you? - Check out the link below to see the explanation of brian d foy and let's see how quickly we can raise the remaining amount? On the Crowdtilt page you can see that both Yanick (who put together a large chunk of this edition), and myself have already contributed a bit. Now it's your turn!",
