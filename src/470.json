Dean, one of the Mentor himself, shared the finer details in this <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/dean/2020/07/perl-mentoring.html\">blog</a>. I would highly recommend if you are new to Perl and want to learn from the expert then please join the program as Mentee. I am sure you would benefit from the experience of highly capable Mentors.",

In the <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/articles/easy-git-workflow.html\">blog</a>, he discussed about git-flow, one of many popular workflow. I would recommend you must check out the blog if you deal with Git on a daily basis.",

I, personally, would like to see it become talk of the town. But then it is my personal view. Also do I have time for any new responsibility? For this, I could probably find the time. You know me, don't you?",
