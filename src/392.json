If you are planning to attend the conferencec then I would recommend <a href=\"https://perlcon.eu/talks/submit\">submit</a> a talk proposal as well. If you are into perl training, like Dave Cross, then why not even submit a workshop. There are already bunch of talks/workshops already submitted as I see listed <a href=\"https://perlcon.eu/talks\">here</a>.",
