      "Hi there",
      "Going back to the editorial of last week's <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/537.html\">edition</a> of Perl Weekly, it is still there in my head raising many questions. It is a universal fact that Perl is no longer the favourite language among the youths in college these days. I remember when I was first introduced to Perl in 1999, it was the most popular language. Being a Perl fan, I feel it is my responsibility to bring Perl back to the discussion table. One way to do that is to talk about Perl-based projects and share them with the users of other languages. I have noticed that not as many people blog about Perl as they used to in the past. Talking about blogs, I would like to thank <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a> team for spreading the power of Perl. For the record, in the last 138 weeks, the team have created and shared over 2000 blog posts. I used to blog regularly in the past but nowadays I hardly find time. Having said that, I still wrte a monthly report blog post where I talk about Perl and my other projects. I find making a live video is less time consuming than writing a blog post. I made some and then I stopped that as well, sorry. You can take a look my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/mohammadsajidanwar\">YouTube Channel</a> if you fancy. I came across series of <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-video-course\">videos</a> by Gabor Szabo teaching Perl. It is great source for someone new to Perl and explore with live action.",
      "I remember, Dave Cross, wrote a <a href=\"https://dev.to/davorg/don-t-be-a-perl-programmer-4h2d\">blog post</a> talking about something that not many people would speak about. I personally agree with him fully and believe knowing more than one programming languages helps you as a programmer. I can tell from my own experience, I picked up Raku last year while participating the weekly challenge. Whatever little I know about Raku to date, I can tell it has helped me a lot. I use that knowledge to write better Perl programs. Recently, I started writing Python as well - just the basics for now. So the question is, does knowing Raku or Python make me any less of a Perl programmer? I am still a Perl programmer and all of my thought processes still follow Perl's rules. Perl is my first love and will remain so for the rest of my life. Even today, after more than 22 years, I find features that I never knew existed before, especially in the field of regex. I would like to give credit to Abigail for sharing the magic of regex in Perl as part of his weekly contributions.",
      "While talking about blogs, how can I miss those who are doing great service on a regular basis? I would like to thank <a href=\"https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY\">Flavio Poletti</a> for blogging every day for months now. Also there is another name, <a href=\"https://phoenixtrap.com\">Mark Gardner</a>, who writes a weekly blog post. Similarly we have weekly stats by <a href=\"https://niceperl.blogspot.com\">Miguel Prz</a>.",
