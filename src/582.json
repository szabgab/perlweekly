      "Few months ago, there was a blog post <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/07/06/why-perl-is-still-relevant-in-2022\">Why Perl is still relevant in 2022</a> created a lot of noise among the <strong>Perl</strong> community. The author clearly missed the point. If you check the comments section, you can see how, White Camel Awardee, <strong>Dave Cross</strong> and few others responed to the post.",
      "I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that <strong>Dave</strong> came up with perfect response to the other blog post with this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/09/08/this-is-not-your-grandfathers-perl\">This is not your grandfather’s Perl</a>. It has already created positive noise. If you want to take a closer look at the recent changes to the latest release of </strong>Perl v5.36</strong> then please do checkout the <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets\">GitHub repository</a> sharing the changes with example. By the way, it is not just limited to <strong>v5.36</strong>. You will find plenty more to keep you busy.",
      "Talking about <strong>Perl</strong>, we got another gem from <strong>Curtis Poe</strong> sharing the <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/articles/current-corinna-status.html\">Current Corinna Status</a>. If you can't wait for <strong>Corinna</strong>, I would suggest you take a look at <strong>CPAN</strong> module <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Pad\">Object::Pad</a> by <strong>Paul Evans</strong>.",
