What I do no is that I agree about the problems with Jenkins and I love to see something like this being developed. It can be an excellent tool for SREs and people whom are often called DevOps engineers. IMHO, in order to make it catch on it needs its own web-site that is not MetaCPAN. It needs to have an installation that does not require any knowledge of Perl. These are two big areas where others could help the project. Of course 'just' using it and reporting any issues would also be extremely valuable.",
