It will run via Zoom and we'll probably use <a href=\"https://cyber-dojo.org/\">Cyber Dojo</a>. It supports Perl 5, though it does not support Raku. Yet. I have hopes that by that time the Raku developers will be able to send a PR to the maintainers of Cyber-Dojo or that we'll have an alternative that also supports Raku. If you are interested to join, send me an e-mail (gabor@szabgab.com), and I'll send you an invitation.",
