      "Good news. The new version of perl is out, just in time to be included in this edition. See the <a href=\"https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2023/07/msg266602.html\">announcement</a> and the <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/release/RJBS/perl-5.38.0/view/pod/perldelta.pod\">perldelta</a> for changes. If I understand correctly the bigges change by far is the addition of the <b>class</b> keyword. There are also a number of deprecations you will want to pay attention to. If you'd like to take it for a ride you can find the instruction <a href=\"https://www.cpan.org/src/README.html\">how to install perl</a>. You can also use <a href=\"https://perlbrew.pl/\">perlbrew</a> to install it. I hope we'll soon have a <a href=\"https://strawberryperl.com/\">Strawberry Perl</a> release as well.",
