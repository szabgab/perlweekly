      "The community spirit among Perl fans is always the highlight of any event. I am sure you have experience it too. Little while ago, there was discussion to give new life to <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong>. Many volunteers came forward to help the project, like, <strong>Adam Russell</strong>. As we are getting close to the next edition, <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> and <strong>Julien Fiegehenn</strong> came together and kickstarted the project with a big push. I noticed in the recent weeks, lots of activities on <a href=\"https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent\">GitHub repository</a>, thanks to all the volunteers. <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> made an official call for papers in the <a href=\"https://www.olafalders.com/2022/07/21/the-perl-advent-calendar-2022-call-for-papers-is-now-open\">blog post</a>. I request all <strong>Perl</strong> fans to submit proposal. If you need any help submitting an article, then please do <a href=\"https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/blob/main/FAQ-submit.mkdn\">checkout the page</a> for guidance. I would encourage first timer to come forward and share their experience with <strong>CPAN</strong> distributions. I am sure, everyone has few favourite distributions or their own creations that they want to talk about and share with the community. There are plenty of help available, if you need, so just give us a shout.",
      "Talking about revival, recently I spoke about <strong>CPAN Weekly</strong>, creation of <strong>Neil Bowers</strong>. I shared my intention of getting it back up. In no time, I got plenty of offer. One of them was <strong>Cheok-Yin Fung</strong>. She even shared the initial draft that I am currently reviewing. Thank you, <strong>Cheok-Yin</strong> for the help. The plan is to launch it on the birthday of <strong>Perl</strong> i.e. 18th Dec. I will share more about it soon. Wish me luck.",

I have seen regular release of <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize\">WWW::Mechanize</a>, thanks to <strong>Julien Fiegehenn</strong> for all the care and love. You can find the details in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simbabque/status/1549670503719153664\">Twitter thread</a>.
