      "Hi there",
      "I came across a blog post by Curtis, titled <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/blog/politics-in-programming.html\">Politics in Programming</a>. As always the case, it has touched sensitive topics. You may or may not agree with his point of view but it is worth a read, imho.",
      "Let me confess, ever since Cor renamed to Corinna, I always double check if there is double \"r\" or double \"n\" in the name. I get it wrong all the time. Jokes apart, I am very happy that Corinna being discussed on so many different public platforms, a BIG thanks to Curtis and his team.",
      "There was another topic discussed on Facebook, \"Data structure in Perl\". It brought back some good old memories when I was first introduced to Perl. I came from C background, so you would assume the transition would have been smooth. It wasn't the case with me. I had hard time to get my head around the \"reference\" in Perl. Once I passed that hurdle, the next disaster was waiting for me i.e. \"regex\". I had no clue about it before. It took me a while to get hold of it. Even after 22 years of working with Perl, I still find regex magic that I have never seen before, thanks to Abigail contributions to <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club\">the weekly challenge</a>. The next big thing I dealt after regex was \"network programming\". The best book to understand the subject is <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/network-programming-with/0201615711/\">Network Programming with Perl</a> by Lincoln D. Stein, imho.",
      "Did you notice, I didn't mention about OO in Perl yet?",
      "It is only because I got the opportunity to actually use OO programming very late in my career. The first book that I read on the subject was <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/object-oriented-perl\">Object Oriented Perl</a> by Damian Conway. It was the first book by Damian that I read and completely fallen in love with it. Of course, how can I miss the next one by Damian, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/perl-best-practices/0596001738/\">Perl Best Practices</a>. I am happy to see Damian giving thumbs up to the Corinna project headed by Curtis in his recent blog, <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2021/08/a-dream-realized.html\">A dream realized</a>. About the future of OO in core Perl, I am not too worried as it is in safe hands now.",
