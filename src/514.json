      "First thing first, I am a big fan of OOP in general. However I do agree OOP is not always the best choice. Since Perl promotes the idea of TIMTOWTDI (There's more than one way to do it), we have plenty of choices to pick from. I have come across many Perl haters in the past complaining about lack of proper OOP support in Perl. With the introduction of postmodern object system for Perl, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose\">Moose</a>, we finally had the structured OOP support. I must confess I prefer <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo\">Moo</a> which is known as minimalist object orientation.",
      "Fast forward, Curtis Poe joined hands with other Perl masters and came up with <a href=\"https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/Corinna-Overview\">Corinna</a>. It is proposed to be part of core Perl soon. I can't wait for that to happen. I sincerely applaud the efforts of each and every contributors of Corinna. It the best addition happens in recent times. I am confident it would be highlight of the future Perl7.",

What a shame, I missed the opportunity. I blame my busy routine for the missed opportunity. I am looking forward to my personal 100th edition of the weekly newsletter. This is the 79th edition for record, not far off from the target.",
