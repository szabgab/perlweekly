If you update that page, please also update <a href=\"https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/blob/master/src/events.json\">the JSON file</a> in the Perl Weekly repository so we can also announce the event. See the upcoming list of events at the bottom of the newsletter.",

I was surprised and quite encouraged to see that more than 100 people have already followed the page and they are also not shy to 'like' to posts that help them spread to even more people. It's like a virus, but a good one. Make sure you don't miss the fun!",
