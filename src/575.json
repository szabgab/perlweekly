      "One of the ongoing discussions in the Perl community is the question of backward compatibility. One group of people say it is (one of) the most important traits of Perl that you can run very old code on a very new version of Perl. The other side mostly say that there are very few cases when this is actually needed and the change in the version of Perl is just one aspect of upgrades people need to handle.",
      "Then comes the case, like the introduction of th $00 variable in Perl 5.32 that breaks the code of people who used that variable for their own purposes. This is not the first case where a change in perl (or for that matter in a CPAN module) breaks some working code. Neither will be the last.",
      "So the question isn't IF there can be changes breaking backward compatibility, but how we deal with them? Do the authors give proper warning? Are there tools to find pieces of code that will be impacted? (e.g. a Perl Critic rule). Are there instructions how to fix the code that will be broken?",
      "On the other side of the coin, how can a user - a user of Perl or a CPAN module - ensure that changes in any of the dependencies won't impact their product or service? How can they notice any impact before it reaches the production system? Possibly even before it reaches the development machines forcing the whole team to stop working.",
