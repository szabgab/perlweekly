Well as is tradition, the next big thing is \"24 Pull Requests\" and for that we have to wait another month. It is a nice break before you start the marathon again. I haven't had much fun with Hacktoberfest this time. How about you? Please do share your story with us when you get time.",
      "Around this time every year, we hold the London Perl Workshop. But the reason that you all know, it has been skipped this yeah. I am already missing the fun day where I always meet great minds. I pray that we can get back to normal soon and start attending these annual meetings. Talking about events, we missed the European Perl/Raku event that was supposed to be happening in Amsterdam this year. I hope we will get the opportunity meet next year.",
