Unfortunately (to us) he got himself busy with some real work and won't be able to allocate the time for copy-editing the Perl Weekly. So now we are looking for a volunteer to do it. Basically every Monday, sometimes during the European morning hours (we don't have a fixed timing), we push out a version to our <a href=\"https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly\">GitHub repo</a> and to the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/\">web-site</a>. Then I'd send an email to the copy-editor who checks the most recent version and sends a Pull-Request on GitHub with the fixes. Once I get the PR, I merge it, regenerate the HTML and send out the newsletter. If you would be interested to volunteer, please get in touch with me so I know whom to notify.",
