      "After almost two weeks in the USA attending YAPC::NA and visiting a friend, I am back at home. Preparing the next issue of the Perl Weekly, working on the Perl Maven articles and doing some class-room training. Let me thank Yanick for preparing the previous two issues. It was a great relief that I did not have to squeeze in the time for the Perl Weekly while waiting for my lost luggage ... err, I mean enjoying YAPC::NA.",
      "If you could not attend YAPC::NA, you might still have a chance to go to another Perl conference. Even this year. If you are from the Far East, you might be interested in either the Beijing Perl Workshop in August, or YAPC::Asia in Tokyo that will be held in September. The Europeans don't need to worry either with YAPC::EU in August in Kiev, and OSDC.fr in October in France. Finally YAPC::Brazil will take place in November. (All the links at the bottom of this issue.)",
