      "After almost two weeks in the USA attending YAPC::NA and visiting a friend, I am back at home. Preparing the next issue of the Perl Weekly, working on the Perl Maven articles and doing some class-room training. Let me thank Yanick for preparing the previous two issues. It was a great relief that I did not have to squeeze in the time for the Perl Weekly while waiting for my lost luggage ... err, I mean enjoying YAPC::NA.",

If you are from the Far East, you might be interested in either the Beijing Perl Workshop in August, or YAPC::Asia in Tokyo that will be held in September. The Europeans don't need to worry either with YAPC::EU in August in Kiev, and OSDC.fr in October in France. Finally YAPC::Brazil will take place in November. (All the links at the bottom of this issue.)",
