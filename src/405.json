In a close vote it was rejected, partially due to the lack of specifics about deployment and hosting options. brian d foy that the hosting question should not be important as the expense is negliable. I tend to agee. One could run a decent system on a 5-10 USD/month box on <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=0d4cc75b3a74\">Digital Ocean</a> that would probably server the Perl 6 users if their number 10 and probably even 100 times more than the current number. If that happens I am sure there will be individuals or companies who will be happy to pay the bill. On the other hand I think the plan for deployment should be part of the grant and the system needs to be deployed from day 1.",
