Having said, I still have to get the slides ready for the my talk about <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a>. If you are planning to attend the conference then please do come and see me. I would love to meet as many Perl enthusiasts as I can. I am mostly looking forward to meet the weekly challenge members.
