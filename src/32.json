      "Now that the Israeli Perl Workshop is over I can start to focus on a few other things again. For example, I'd like to do some more promotion for the Perl Weekly. I already created a <a href=https://perlweekly.com/promotion.html>page with some links</a> and I'd like to ask for your help. One of the best ways you could help is recommending the Perl Weekly to a co-worker or a fellow Perl Monger or just by asking if they are already subscribed?",
