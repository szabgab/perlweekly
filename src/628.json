      "Hi there,",
      "Ever since the release of <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>, I have been thinking of playing with it but never got anything interesting to work on. <strong>Chris Prather</strong> is taking the lead to my knowledge, sorry if I missed anyone else. You can checkout the <a href=\"https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-0.html\">Part 0</a>, <a href=\"https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-1.html\">Part 1</a>, <a href=\"https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-2.html\">Part 2</a>,,<a href=\"https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-3.html\">Part 3</a>, <a href=\"https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-4.html\">Part 4</a>, <a href=\"https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-5.html\">Part 5</a> and <a href=\"https://chris.prather.org/perl-roguelike-part-6.html\">Part 6</a>. We should all be gratefull that <strong>Chris</strong> is making an effort to showcase the power of <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>. I would also like to mention another name, <strong>Renee Baker</strong>, who shared his encounter with the latest release in the <a href=\"https://blog.perl-academy.de/2023-08-01-ein-groaer-klassenunterschied-class\">blog post</a>, originally written in <strong>German</strong> but I used browser translate feature to read in <strong>English</strong>. Kudos to their efforts for sharing the knowledge with us. I applaud their dedications and love for <strong>Perl</strong>.",
      "One of core team member, <strong>Steven Little</strong> of <strong>Corinna</strong> started project, <a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/Stella\">Stella</a>, using the latest release of <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>. It also reminded me a <a href=\"https://ovid.github.io/blog/politics-in-programming.html\">blog post</a> by <strong>Curtis Poe</strong> shared <strong>2 years ago</strong>. I still find it very usefull and handy.",
      "<strong>Have you done anything with Perl v5.38?</strong>",
      "If yes then please do share with us so that we can make it public here with the community. In <strong>2021</strong>, I shared the <strong>Design Pattern</strong> implementation using <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo\">Moo</a> and family in the <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/Design-Patterns\">GitHub repository</a>. With so much happenings with <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>, I tried to re-implement <a href=\"https://github.com/manwar/Design-Patterns/tree/master/00-class-feature/01-singleton\">Singleton</a> just for fun using the new experimental feature <strong>class</strong>. I will see what else I can do next with the limited features we have in <strong>Perl v5.38</strong>.",
      "<strong>Facebook and Perl ...</strong>",
      "As most of you know, we have two very active <strong>Facebook groups</strong> primarily dedicated to the <strong>Perl</strong> language i.e. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity\">The Perl Community</a> managed by <strong>Curtis Poe</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers\">Perl Programmers</a> managed by <strong>Will Braswell</strong>. Fortunately, I am one of the moderators for both <strong>Perl</strong> groups in <strong>Facebook</strong>. Of the two groups, one is private and the other is public. <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>, the chief editor of the <strong>Perl weekly</strong> newsletter, joined the Facebook group with much fanfare. Everyone welcomed him with open hands. I was happy to see him sharing his valuable ideas with the group members. Last week <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/627.html\">newsletter</a> editorial created so much noise that <strong>Gabor</strong> decided to leave the <strong>Perl Programmers</strong> group. Only recently we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1H9yKf8BI0\">heard</a> from <strong>Sawyer X</strong> about the abuse he received and how he decided to stay away from any future <strong>Perl meetups/conferences</strong>. What a loss to <strong>Perl Community</strong> in general. <strong>Dave Cross</strong> also left the group in the similar fashion but luckily he is still active. If we start loosing stalwarts like this then very soon we will not have anyone to lookup for advice/guidance.",
      "I am writing this editorial midweek (Thursday night) as I am flying to India on Friday morning. By the time you get this newsletter, I would be in India. I will checkout the response on social media platform. Let us all try to create friendly space where everyone is welcome.",
      "Enjoy the rest of the newsletter and stay safe."
