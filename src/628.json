Fortunately, I am one of the moderators for both <strong>Perl</strong> groups in <strong>Facebook</strong>. Of the two groups, one is private and the other is public. <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong>, the chief editor of the <strong>Perl weekly</strong> newsletter, joined the Facebook group with much fanfare. Everyone welcomed him with open hands. I was happy to see him sharing his valuable ideas with the group members. Last week <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/627.html\">newsletter</a> editorial created so much noise that <strong>Gabor</strong> decided to leave the <strong>Perl Programmers</strong> group. Only recently we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1H9yKf8BI0\">heard</a> from <strong>Sawyer X</strong> about the abuse he received and how he decided to stay away from any future <strong>Perl meetups/conferences</strong>. What a loss to <strong>Perl Community</strong> in general. <strong>Dave Cross</strong> also left the group in the similar fashion but luckily he is still active. If we start loosing stalwarts like this then very soon we will not have anyone to lookup for advice/guidance.",
