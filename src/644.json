Without a doubt they are doing great service promoting <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> programming languages. I have personally seen how they support annual conferences around the globe.",
      "<strong>Why am I talking about it today?</strong>",
      "I run <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org\">The Weekly Challenge</a> project primarily focus on <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> but open to all programming languages. It was started on <strong>25th March 2019</strong>. It has been going on un-interrupted ever since, thanks to the strong <strong>350+</strong> members of <strong>Team PWC</strong>. We were lucky enough to have solo sponsor, <a href=\"https://perl.careers\">Perl Careers</a> run by <strong>Peter Sergeant</strong> since <strong>July 2019</strong> without break. Initially we had weekly prize sponsorship but later it was changed to monthly sponsorship. The best part was, I didn't have to move a finger to find the sponsor. <strong>Pete</strong> was generous enough to come forward and continued supporting the project for such a long time.",
      "<strong>Is it time to look for new sponsor?</strong>",
      "Well, we are not expensive to sponsor, honestly speaking. The prize money has been <strong>50 USD</strong> since the beginning. Although I have been looking for new sponsors for sometime but never done anything about it. It is just not my cup of tea. Because of this, I put the code move on hold for such a long time. Ideally I wanted to move the code base to pure <strong>Perl</strong> solution instead of currently <strong>Hugo</strong> which is based on <strong>Go</strong>. I also wanted to move away from <strong>GitHub pages</strong> hosted solution to a proper hosted solution that we can manage ourself. I could have requested <strong>TPRF</strong> for financial help but again I am not competent enough to make formal request. As we are growing very fast every week, it is getting out of hand to manage the contributions by the team member. <strong>GitHub</strong> takes lot longer to process the data as some of the team member complained about it too. I wish we had our own repository to manage the contributions.",
