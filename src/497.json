If you are using a perl.com host for your CPAN mirror you should use www.cpan.org instead (See <a href=\"https://log.perl.org/2021/01/perlcom-hijacked.html\">this post</a>.) You can also find the content of <a href=\"https://perldotcom.perl.org/\">perl.com on perldotcom.perl.org</a>. Ask brian d foy (brian.d.foy@gmail.com) for further details.
