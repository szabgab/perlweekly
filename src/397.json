Wow, they speak fast and skip parts of the words. Not to mention that often they speak a language that is clearly not Spanish, but has many words in it that I could recognize. I guess it was Catalan, but I have not figured out if Catalan has a lot of common words with Spanish or if they just freely mixed the two languages. Not to mention the time when they speak French to us. At least then I knew immediately I have no chance. It must be interesting to constantly speak 3-4 languages and try to guess which one to use with which person.",
