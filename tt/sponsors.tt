The Perl Weekly newsletter reaches more than 5,000 Perl programmers every week. Not only that, but these are exactly those
people who are interested in Perl a lot more than the average "Perl user". They put in time and energy following what's new in the
Perl world.
<p>
If you are looking for Perl programmers this is probably the best place to reach them. You can put your job-ad in the newsletter and
it will also remain in the archive. (See issue for example issue <a href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/83.html">#83</a>. )
<p>
Technical details:
<ul>
  <li>A sponsored job ad can have a linked title and 2-3 lines of text.</li>
  <li>The title is up to 80 characters.</li>
  <li>The text is up to 300 characters.</li>
  <li>The title will be linked to the URL of your choice.</li>
  <li>It will be included in the newsletter and kept in the archive.</li>
</ul>
